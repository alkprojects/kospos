# Labor Report — tab-by-tab reference

The authoritative deep-dive on Alex's `Labor Report 5.21.26.xlsx` (and its successor
weekly snapshots). This file is the **blueprint for Phase 2 (Current-Year Workspace)**:
every tab here has a corresponding workspace concept in KosPos. The KosPos rebuild is
**not a 1:1 visual recreation** — Alex's explicit direction: combine and improve where
that produces a better workflow. A KosPos page may correspond to several Excel tabs,
or one tab may split into multiple KosPos surfaces.

**Status: walkthrough in progress.** Tabs marked _walkthrough — done YYYY-MM-DD_ are
fully captured; others carry an initial Purpose stub from Alex's high-level description
and the rest of the template marked _walkthrough — pending_.

## How to use this file

Each tab section follows the same template:

- **Status** — `walkthrough — pending` / `walkthrough — in progress` / `walkthrough — done YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Purpose** — what the tab is for; who reads it.
- **Data sources** — where the inputs come from. Includes v1 upload format and the
  path-to-Snowflake for v2.
- **Formulas** — every non-obvious formula decoded, with cell coordinates back to the
  workbook so a future session can re-verify.
- **What's manual / fragile** — places where the tab silently depends on a human having
  remembered something (hardcoded constants, copy-pasted values, DBI-specific shortcuts).
- **KosPos improvements** — what we'd do differently in the rebuild.
- **KosPos UI sketch** — rough notes on how this becomes a surface in the app.
- **Excel export notes** — what the corresponding sheet/column in the KosPos-emitted
  `.xlsx` should look like.
- **Open questions / TODO** — anything left to confirm with Alex or research.

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Calendar-tab constants

`Calendar!I2` (PPs elapsed) / `J2` (total PPs in FY) / `K2` (remaining) are referenced by
nearly every per-tab formula. KosPos derives these from the pay calendar once, then
exposes them as reactive constants — never copy-pasted. See [`definitions.md`](definitions.md)
§ "Pay Period (PP)" and the Calendar tab section below.

### Fund-level filters

The workbook commonly filters to fund **10190** (DBI's operating fund) — a DBI shortcut.
KosPos defaults to "all funds" and offers a per-tab fund filter so other departments
that post to special revenue / capital / grant funds aren't silently under-counted.

### Dept-group rollup

Most tabs roll up to `Department Group Code = "DBI"`. KosPos treats this as the
dept-group dimension; multi-dept extension is a Phase 3 concern.

### Live data, never stale pivots

**Pain point from the Excel workflow:** when a pivot table updates (row count grows or
shrinks), the formulas referencing it next-cell-over **don't move with it**. Excel has
features to fix this (tables, structured references, Power Query) but they take time to
learn and retrofit. **In KosPos this category of bug doesn't exist** — every derived
view is a live query against the underlying dataset, not a pivot snapshot with a
formula range hardcoded next to it. Surface this benefit explicitly in the rebuild's
onboarding: "stop pasting refreshes into adjacent formulas."

### Access control (v1 + future)

Eventual target: **Microsoft Active Directory / Entra ID SSO** (`@sfgov.org` accounts),
aligned with the broader citywide-tenancy goal in [ADR-001](../DECISIONS.md). For v1,
a lightweight password gate is acceptable. Suggested approaches in order of preference:

1. **Static-site-friendly password protection** at the deploy layer — GitHub Pages
   itself doesn't support auth, but we can move v1 hosting to Cloudflare Pages (free,
   supports Access policies including a one-time PIN to allow-listed email addresses)
   or Netlify (similar). Lowest-friction path that doesn't require touching the React
   code.
2. **In-app password hash check** with a single shared password configured at build
   time. Trivial to implement, but the bundle is still publicly downloadable, so the
   gate is security-by-obscurity for the data inside the app, not real auth.
3. **No gate, obscure URL** — defer auth, treat as internal-only by convention. Worst.

For real auth without standing up our own backend, recommended path: **Cloudflare
Access with Entra ID SAML/OIDC** once SF IT signs off on a tenant. Until then,
Cloudflare Access with email PIN to a hand-maintained allow-list is the safest
intermediate. Track in [DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) when the call is made.

### Bargaining unit (BU) — used throughout this file

A **bargaining unit (BU)** is a group of city employees who share one union contract
(MOU). Each MOU sets that BU's wage table and COLA schedule. Examples: SEIU 1021
Miscellaneous (the largest "Misc" unit), IFPTE Local 21 (professional / technical),
MEA (some managers), POA (police), Local 798 (fire), and ~30 others citywide. Each
job class maps to exactly one BU at a time.

**Why this matters for the labor report rebuild:** different BUs have different COLA
effective dates and percentages. DBI's entire job-class population happens to sit
under a single Misc schedule, which is why Calendar can use one COLA column. A
department mixing BUs (clerical + licensed engineers, say) needs per-BU COLA
treatment. We use the abbreviation **BU** throughout the rest of this file.

A separate `domain/bargaining-units.md` (and/or `data-sources/dhr.md` extension) is a
**TODO for Phase 2.2** — see the Open Questions list.

### Controller-side data masking (sick-leave bucket)

The OBI BI Payroll export the workbook ingests has **sick-leave TRCs hidden by
the Controller** and replaced with a single opaque earnings code `XXX` /
description `***Unspecified***`. At this snapshot the masked bucket carries
$3.51M (4.2% of FYTD payroll). This is a deliberate Controller-side privacy
posture: sick-leave usage by employee is sensitive (HIPAA-adjacent + PII risk
when joined to Person Number).

Alex has access to a permission level that unmasks the detail but doesn't need
it for labor-report work, so he runs the masked report. **KosPos must preserve
this posture by default** — the importer keeps `XXX` as a single opaque bucket
and surfaces a Data Issues note ("$X of YTD payroll is in the Controller's
masked sick-leave bucket. This is expected.") rather than a warning. Unmasked
detail is an admin-role-only feature gated behind a separately permissioned
upload.

See Tab 7 (BI Payroll) § Manual / fragile and § KosPos improvements #4 for
details.

### Multi-dept generalization caveats (DBI shortcuts to undo)

Catalog of DBI-only assumptions that need to be parameterized for citywide use:

| Shortcut | Lives in | Generalization |
|---|---|---|
| Single COLA % applied to all DBI job classes | Calendar tab (hardcoded) | Per-MOU COLA schedule lookup, joined by job class → bargaining unit |
| Fund 10190 filter | Many tabs | "All funds" default + per-tab fund filter |
| TEMPM = COMMN:5380 only | Operating Report `E40` | Definition-aware temp filter (see [`definitions.md`](definitions.md)) |
| 7.65% OT fringe hardcoded | Budget Master (cross-ref OVERM) | OASDI+Medicare derived constant with year-stamped wage cap |
| `15.4 / 26.1` PP constants in OVERM `AW` | Budget Master | Pull live from Calendar `I2 / J2` |
| `BFM 15.10.006 FY26` row addresses | Multi-tab BFM lookups | Lookup by `(dept, account, fund, authority)` not by row index |
| Single "DBI" dept-group rollup | All tabs | Dept-group dimension, default selectable |
| Account Description literals scattered across Step / Report Data / OPS formulas (`"Overtime - Scheduled Misc"` etc.) | Step, Report Data, Operating Report Summary | Central chart-of-accounts map (versioned by effective date); importer warns on Controller-side renames before they break aggregations |
| BI Payroll fund 10190 filter on Step's per-PP SUMIFS | Step | Multi-fund per-position aggregation; per-call fund filter optional |
| `'COMMN:5380'` job-code prefix as implicit citywide knowledge | BI Payroll consumers (Step, Report Data, TEMPM, Inactive) | Strip prefix at import; store `{job_code, job_code_set}` separately |
| Single masked sick-leave bucket (`XXX`) accepted as opaque | BI Payroll (and downstream rollups that absorb it) | Preserve masking; admin-only unmask via separately permissioned upload |
| DBI-only manual lookup table in OBI for `Effective Employee Division` (column CH); CPC rows get the literal `"Update Formula"` placeholder | P&P Data CH (and any view reading it) | Join Position Department ID to citywide `Department Classification Structure` tree; placeholder ceases to exist |
| 11-level `Level 1…11` hierarchy climb materialized in 44 columns next to P&P Data | P&P Data CO:DJ + DL:EG (read by Reporting Tree pivot) | Compute hierarchy lazily by walking `reports_to_position_id`; cap not at 11 |

## Per-tab detail

---

### Tab 1 — Data

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Reference index listing some of the upstream data sources used by the
workbook. Not a working tab — for human navigation.

**Data sources / Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel
export / Open questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 2 — Departments

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** List of all departments in DBI and CPC. KosPos's target scope is the
**entire citywide department tree**, not just DBI/CPC — see
`Department Classification Structure (16).csv` (PS HCM export) in
`C:\Users\ALK\Desktop\Claude Projects\Position Management\example reports\Reports\`.

**Data sources:** PS HCM (`Department Classification Structure` export). v1 = manual
upload of the CSV; v2 = scheduled pull when city systems expose it. Not currently in
the per-source docs — **TODO: add `docs/data-sources/` note about the department-tree
export** (likely belongs under [`ps-hcm.md`](../data-sources/ps-hcm.md)).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 3 — Combo

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** List of combo codes (chartfield string aliases) for DBI and CPC.

**Data sources:** PS HCM query — `MRG_COMBO_CD_DEPT (5).csv` in
`C:\Users\ALK\Desktop\Claude Projects\Position Management\example reports\Reports\`.
v1 = manual upload; v2 = scheduled pull.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — Alex to explain combo codes and their use)_

**Purpose:** Approved position eturn from the prior cycle, when FY26 was BY. Used as
historical/anchor lookups by formulas elsewhere in the workbook.

**Data sources:** BFM 15.10.006 position eturn. See
[`../data-sources/bfm.md`](../data-sources/bfm.md) and ADR-004.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 5 — Calendar

**Status:** walkthrough — done 2026-05-24

**Purpose:** The pay-calendar lookup tab. Provides three things:

1. **Per-PP rows** (rows 2–28, one per PP from 1 through 27) with the canonical PPE
   date for the FY.
2. **Two parallel running totals** — a pure-PP elapsed count (col D) and a
   COLA-weighted elapsed count (col F).
3. **Single-row summary block** (cols H–O, row 2) that derives "today's PP" from the
   BI Payroll data, then computes elapsed / total / remaining in both tracks.

Almost every downstream tab references this tab's summary cells. The columns split
along usage lines (verified by counting `Calendar!` refs across all formulas in the
workbook):

| Track | Cells | Used by (column refs) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pure-PP | `I2 / J2 / K2` | Operating Report Summary (28), Overtime (22), Premium (4), Retirement Payout (4), Staffing Plan (4), Budget Summary (1) | Straight-line time-pacing of budget and special-class projections |
| COLA-weighted | `M2 / N2 / O2` | Report Data (~1,400), Step (16,335), Budget Summary (1) | Per-position salary projection and step-savings projection — needs to honor the mid-year COLA |
| Date lookup | col `B` | Step (49,032 — per-PP iteration), Report Data (27) | `XLOOKUP(some_date, Calendar!B, Calendar!C)` returns the PP% for an arbitrary date |
| Per-PP COLA delta | col `E` | Step (16,335) | Step formulas walk each PP and apply the COLA in effect at that PP |

Background pay-period anchors (80-hour PP, 26/26.1/26.2 PPs per FY, PP1 starts 7/1,
PP27 ends 6/30) live in [`definitions.md`](definitions.md) § "Pay Period (PP)" — not
repeated here.

**Data sources:**

- **Source:** Controller's Office Payroll Division annual pay calendar (PPE dates).
  See [`../data-sources/controller.md`](../data-sources/controller.md).
- **Plus:** the Misc-unit MOU COLA schedule (SEIU 1021 Misc 2024–2027), for the in-year
  COLA effective dates and percentages. See [`budget-process.md`](budget-process.md)
  § "SF historical COLAs."
- **v1 mechanism:** Alex re-develops the tab manually each FY — ~30 minutes of work
  pulling PPE dates from the Controller's calendar and dropping in the MOU's mid-year
  COLA % at the correct PP row.
- **v2 plan:** KosPos generates Calendar from (a) the Controller's published pay
  calendar (a JSON or scraped PDF) and (b) the per-bargaining-unit COLA schedule from
  DHR MOUs. Citywide artifact; no per-department version.

**Structure — per-PP rows (A2:F28):**

| Col | Header | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | PP | PP number (1–27) | Integer |
| B | PPE | Pay Period End date | Literal date (FY26: B2=2025-07-04 … B28=2026-06-30) |
| C | PP% | This PP's contribution to the FY | 1.0 for full PPs; PP1=0.4 (formula); PP27=0.7 (formula) |
| D | Total | Cumulative PP elapsed at end of this PP | `=D{n-1}+C{n}`; `MAX(D:D) = J2` = 26.1 for FY26 |
| E | COLA | The COLA % effective during this PP | Blank for PP1:PP14; **`0.015` for PP15:PP27** (the SEIU 1021 Misc Jan 3, 2026 +1.5%) |
| F | Total COLA | Cumulative C+E | `=F{n-1}+(C{n}+E{n})`; `MAX(F:F) = N2` = 26.295 ≈ "26.3" |

**Structure — summary block (H1:O2):**

| Cell | Formula | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| H2 | `=MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)` | "Today's PPE" — latest pay period end date in the BI Payroll export. Drives all elapsed computations |
| I2 | `=XLOOKUP(H2, B:B, D:D)` | PP elapsed, pure (22.4 at this snapshot) |
| J2 | `=MAX(D:D)` | Total PPs in FY, pure (26.1) |
| K2 | `=J2 - I2` | PPs remaining, pure (3.7) |
| L2 | `=B16` | Date the mid-year COLA first takes full effect (= end of PP15 = 2026-01-16) |
| M2 | `=XLOOKUP(H2, B:B, F:F)` | PP elapsed, COLA-weighted (22.535) |
| N2 | `=MAX(F:F)` | Total PPs in FY, COLA-weighted (26.295) |
| O2 | `=N2 - M2` | PPs remaining, COLA-weighted (3.76) |

**Formulas — derived:**

- `C2 = NETWORKDAYS(DATE(YEAR(B2),7,1), B2) / 10` — PP1 partial. Counts weekdays from
  7/1 to PPE, divides by 10. FY26: 7/1=Tue through 7/4=Fri → 4 weekdays → 0.4.
- `C28 = NETWORKDAYS(B27+1, DATE(YEAR(B28),6,30)) / 10` — PP27 spillover. Weekdays
  from the day after PP26 ends to 6/30. FY26: 6/20 through 6/30 → 7 weekdays → 0.7.
- `D{n} = D{n-1} + C{n}` — cumulative pure PPs.
- `F{n} = F{n-1} + (C{n} + E{n})` — cumulative COLA-adjusted PPs. The COLA delta
  (`E{n}`, e.g., 0.015) is **added** as if it were a PP fraction, not multiplied. Math
  works out: each post-COLA PP contributes 1.015 instead of 1.0 to the running total.

**The "26.3 trick" — what's actually happening:**

`J2 = 26.1` (the real FY26 PP count). `N2 = 26.295` (≈ 26.3) is **not** the real PP
count; it's a synthetic "COLA-equivalent" PP count. Downstream projections that use
`actual * N2 / M2` instead of `actual * J2 / I2` inflate the projection slightly to
account for the fact that the post-COLA remaining PPs cost ~1.5% more per PP than the
COLA-mix of YTD PPs.

Worked numbers at this snapshot (`H2 = 2026-05-08`):

| Ratio | Value | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| Pure: `J2 / I2` | 26.1 / 22.4 | 1.1652 |
| COLA-weighted: `N2 / M2` | 26.295 / 22.535 | 1.1668 |
| Delta | | 0.14% |

The delta is small at this point in the year (most of the COLA bump is already in YTD).
Earlier in the year, the spread would be larger.

**What's manual / fragile:**

- **Whole tab is rebuilt every FY.** PPE dates change; PP1/PP27 partial fractions
  change; the COLA effective PP changes; the COLA % changes.
- **Single COLA % column E is a DBI shortcut.** Column E carries one rate (0.015 for
  FY26). This works only because every DBI job class happens to sit under the SEIU
  1021 Misc MOU with the same Jan 3, 2026 +1.5% bump. Departments mixing bargaining
  units (Misc + IFPTE 21 + 798/Fire + POA) cannot share a single column — each BU has
  its own COLA effective dates and percentages.
- **Only the largest mid-year COLA is modeled.** Per the FY26 MOU schedule
  (`budget-process.md` table), FY26 actually has three rate changes:
  - Jul 1, 2025 (+1.0%) — baked into starting salary rates by PP1; not in Calendar.
  - Jan 3, 2026 (+1.5%) — **modeled** as E16:E28 = 0.015.
  - Jun 30, 2026 (+2.0%) — one day before FY27 starts; ignored as immaterial.
  
  Future FYs with two material mid-year bumps will need two non-zero ranges in E.
- **`N2 / M2` is treated as a single workbook-wide ratio.** Anywhere it's used, the
  assumption is "this ratio applies to all dollars." Bargaining-unit-specific
  application isn't expressed.
- **`H2 = MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)` couples the "as-of date" to the payroll import.**
  If BI Payroll is imported through a different PPE than the rest of the data (Report
  Data may be from an earlier P&P snapshot), the elapsed-PP math will be off. Currently
  managed by Alex importing all sources at the same as-of date.

**KosPos improvements:**

#### 1. Separate pay-calendar arithmetic from COLA application

**Problem in the workbook.** Calendar column F (`Total COLA`) is derived in the same
tab as the pay-period dates and percentages. Column F = column D + column E, where E
is a single MOU's schedule. The tab fuses two unrelated facts:

- **Pay calendar** = a citywide, controller-published artifact. Every department uses
  the same dates. Changes once per FY.
- **COLA schedule** = a per-bargaining-unit policy. Different MOUs land at different
  times with different rates. Updates whenever an MOU is ratified or amended.

Fusing them works for DBI because DBI is single-BU; it does not scale to a citywide
app, where adding a second BU means adding a second column to the shared calendar,
adding a third BU means a third column, and so on.

**KosPos design.** Two independent modules:

- **`lib/calendar/`** — pure pay-period arithmetic. Citywide; not dept- or BU-aware.
  - Inputs: one JSON per FY (PP number → PPE date, partial-PP fraction).
  - Functions:
    - `dateToPP(date, fy) → { pp, fraction, ppe }`
    - `ppToDates(pp, fy) → { start, end }`
    - `ppsElapsed(asOfDate, fy) → number`
    - `ppsInFY(fy) → number` (26.0 / 26.1 / 26.2)
    - `ppsRemaining(asOfDate, fy) → number`
  - Generated annually from the Controller's published calendar; checked into source
    control so historical years remain queryable.
- **`lib/cola/`** (or as part of `lib/dhr/`) — per-bargaining-unit COLA schedule.
  - Lookup: `bargainingUnit → [{ effectiveDate, percent, mouCitation }]`.
  - Sourced from the DHR MOU PDFs (each MOU's Wages article is the authority).
  - Versioned by effective date so historical projections re-derive correctly.

**Why the split matters.** When the FY27-30 MOU is ratified in mid-2027 with a
surprise mid-FY27 COLA, KosPos updates **only** `lib/cola/` — pay-calendar code
doesn't move. Conversely, when the Controller shifts a holiday and bumps a PPE date by
one day, only `lib/calendar/` moves. The blast radius of each change is small and
isolated.

#### 2. Annualization function takes both

**Problem in the workbook.** The user has to pick the correct ratio per tab:
`J2/I2` (pure) for OVERM/PREMM/RTPOM, `N2/M2` (COLA-weighted) for Step and Report
Data. The choice is implicit and not documented anywhere obvious — a new analyst won't
know why Overtime uses one and Step uses the other.

**KosPos design.** All projections are **COLA-aware by default** — that's the
correct math. Straight-line is provided only as an **optional simplified view** for
quick reads and parity-checks against the existing workbook; it is never the
authoritative number a KosPos report emits.

A single `project()` function:

```ts
project({
  actualsYTD: number,
  asOfDate: Date,
  fy: number,
  bargainingUnit: string,
  method: 'cola-aware' | 'straight-line',  // default: 'cola-aware'
}) → { projectedAnnual: number, breakdown: ... }
```

`cola-aware` walks the remaining PPs and applies the rate in effect at each.
For a single-MOU population (DBI today), this collapses to a single multiplier —
output matches the workbook's `N2/M2` math exactly. For a mixed-BU population (e.g.,
a future dept with SEIU 1021 + IFPTE 21 staff), the function produces the correct
per-BU projection rather than a flat one-size-fits-all multiplier.

**Per-labor-type projection methods are a separate discussion per labor type, not
shared defaults.** Each labor type (regular labor, overtime, premium, retirement
payout, step, temp, etc.) has its own projection nuances — straight-line annualize,
seasonality-aware, hire-plan-aware, lump-sum, residual. Those choices are decided
when that labor type's tab is walked, not here. **Universal invariant:** whatever
method a tab uses, KosPos always feeds the per-BU COLA schedule through it so the
final number reflects scheduled raises through the projection horizon. Alex's
workbook sometimes uses `J2/I2` (pure straight-line) for OT / Premium / Retirement
Payout — that's a workbook shortcut for simplicity. KosPos does not inherit that
shortcut as its default; the correct answer is always COLA-aware.

**Worked example.** OT YTD $438k at PP 22.4 / 26.1, BU = SEIU 1021 Misc:
- `cola-aware` (KosPos default): $438k × 26.295 / 22.535 = **$511k** ← the answer KosPos emits
- `straight-line` (optional shortcut view): $438k × 26.1 / 22.4 = **$510k**
- Workbook today emits $510k for OT; KosPos emits $511k. Both are surfaced in
  parity-check views during the rebuild.

#### 3. Show the correct projection prominently; surface straight-line as a check

**Problem in the workbook.** Only one number lands in the cell, and the math behind
it isn't obvious — for some tabs the cell is straight-line, for others COLA-aware.
The user can't see how much of the projection comes from "real activity continuing
forward" vs. "scheduled raises hitting the back half of the year." For exec-facing
reports this matters: when the projection rises run-to-run, leadership wants to know
whether it's because of overspend or because of a known scheduled raise.

**KosPos design.** The COLA-aware number is the headline (it's the correct math).
The straight-line number is rendered next to it as a labeled "simplified view" —
useful for quick sanity checks and for matching the workbook during parity testing,
but never the number that goes in a KosPos report.

```
Overtime projection
  $511,000  (year-end, COLA-aware) ← headline
  Simplified (no COLA): $510,000   ← side-note, lower visual weight
  Variance vs G37 budget: -$131,000
```

When the spread is below a threshold (e.g., 0.1% — late in the year) the simplified
view collapses into a tooltip on the headline number. Always queryable, never
overshadowing the correct figure.

**Secondary benefit — data-quality flag.** If a class has no bargaining unit
assigned, the COLA-aware projection has no raises to apply for that class and
becomes numerically identical to the straight-line view. In a department where the
dominant spread should be ~1.5%, a class with zero spread is a missing-BU flag. The
Data Issues panel (per ADR-003) picks this up automatically.

**Tertiary benefit — cross-dept comparison.** Two departments with similar
profiles should have similar spreads. If they don't, that's diagnostic: one has BU
mappings the other lacks, or one is heavy in a class on a different MOU.

#### 4. Treat the late-fiscal-year COLA bump as a policy rule, not an oversight

**Problem in the workbook.** Column E intentionally omits the Jun 30, 2026 +2.0%
bump because it lands on the FY's last weekday (one day of impact ≈ zero dollars).
This works, but it's an undocumented call — a future analyst reading the workbook
won't know whether the omission is "wrong" or "deliberate."

**KosPos design.** A documented inclusion rule in `lib/cola/`:

> A COLA effective date is included in the FY's projection if it lands on or before
> a PPE whose `ppToFraction(pp) = 1.0` (i.e., a full PP). Effective dates within the
> spillover days of PP27 are recorded but produce zero in-year impact (the formula
> still applies them; the math just multiplies by ~0.7 / 26.1 of a tiny rate change).

This generalizes the workbook's special-case to a rule. Edge cases the rule handles
correctly without extra logic:

- **A Jul 1 bump for the upcoming FY** — outside the current FY, doesn't apply at all.
- **A late-FY bump in a year with a longer PP27** — automatically downweighted by the
  fraction.
- **A retroactive MOU bump** — applied to the PPs it covers, regardless of when it
  was ratified.

**Rule-vs-cosmetic distinction.** Don't *exclude* late-FY bumps from the data; let
the math downweight them naturally. Excluding by threshold is a cosmetic shortcut
that breaks the moment someone adjusts the threshold. The math is correct as long as
the per-PP COLA delta `E{n}` is the rate-change contribution **for that PP only**.

#### 5. Decouple "as-of date" from the BI Payroll import

**Problem in the workbook.** `H2 = MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)` ties the "today" cell to
one specific source. If a user wants to ask "what would the projection look like if
we'd run this report at PP 15?" — or if Report Data is pulled from an earlier P&P
snapshot than BI Payroll — the answer is "rebuild the workbook with a hacked H2
cell." Painful.

**KosPos design.** A first-class `asOfDate` state value on every projection page:

- Default = `MAX(PPE)` across all imported sources (matches workbook behavior).
- Visible as a control at the top of every projection page: `Projecting as of PP22
  (5/8/2026) ▼`.
- Override via dropdown / date picker. Common presets: latest, 6-month report, 9-month
  report, end of last quarter, end of PP15, FY end.
- Validation: cannot exceed the latest PPE present in any source the projection
  depends on. Surfaces a warning if the as-of date pre-dates a source's earliest data.

**Use cases this unlocks:**

- **Retrospective verification.** "What did the 6-month projection say at the time?"
  Pick `asOfDate = 12/12/2025`. Compare to the saved 6-month report.
- **Cross-source consistency.** If P&P is from 5/1 and BI Payroll is from 5/8,
  setting `asOfDate = 5/1` projects from the earlier date for both — avoids
  apples-to-oranges. Conversely, leaving as `5/8` and getting a warning highlights
  that P&P needs a fresher pull.
- **What-if planning.** "If we don't hire anyone else this year, what does year-end
  look like as of today?" Doesn't require a calendar change; only the hiring-plan
  inputs.
- **Parity testing.** When verifying KosPos's math against a snapshot of the
  workbook, set `asOfDate` to match the workbook's `H2` exactly — projections become
  directly comparable.

#### 6. PP27 + percentage progress in user-facing displays

**Problem in the workbook.** `J2 = 26.1` is correct for math but opaque for an exec
audience. "We're at PP 22.4 of 26.1" requires explaining the fractional PP. Reports
sent to CON/MYR/the Board need a different framing.

**KosPos design.** Three parallel forms, picked per audience:

| Form | Used in | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Fractional PP** | Internal math, formulas, tooltips | `22.4 / 26.1` |
| **Whole PP + spillover** | Operations dashboards | "PP 22 of 26 (plus 7-day spillover to FY27)" |
| **Percent of FY elapsed** | Exec-facing reports, 6-/9-month report titles | "86% through FY26" |

Each displays the same underlying state in a different presentation. No duplicated
calculation — all derive from `ppsElapsed / ppsInFY`. A "format" prop on display
components picks the right rendering.

**Why the third form matters.** When a Board member sees "projected year-end actuals
$580k vs budget $380k," the immediately useful follow-up is "at 86% through the
year, are we overspent by 53% or pacing 53%?" The workbook hides this; KosPos surfaces
it.

#### 7. Version the calendar by FY and persist historical calendars

**New (not in the current workbook).** The workbook only carries the current FY's
calendar; prior FYs' calendars live in prior workbook files. KosPos persists every
imported FY's calendar JSON in `lib/calendar/data/`. When the user opens a Past Year
workspace (Phase 5), the right calendar loads automatically. Re-deriving an FY18
projection won't accidentally use FY26's PPE dates or COLA schedule.

#### 8. Validate the calendar against the published source

**New.** When the user uploads a new FY's calendar JSON (or KosPos generates one
from the Controller's PDF), run a sanity-check pass:

- Exactly 26 or 27 rows.
- PP1 starts on the first weekday on/after 7/1.
- PP27 (if present) ends on the last weekday on/before 6/30.
- Sum of `PP%` = 26.0 / 26.1 / 26.2 (matches the published FY total).
- Per-BU COLA effective dates fall on or between FY start and FY end.

Failures surface in the Data Issues panel rather than producing silently-wrong math.
The workbook has no equivalent check — a typo in column B silently breaks every
downstream projection.

**KosPos UI sketch:**

Internal-only — not a user-facing tab. Surfaces as:

- A **reference-data admin panel** (Settings → Reference Data → Pay Calendar) showing
  the current FY's per-PP table with date, PP%, and (per BU) COLA rate. Editable by
  admin role for the rare late-announced Controller schedule shift.
- A **live "as of" indicator** at the top of every projection page: `Projecting as of
  PP22 of 26 (PPE 2026-05-08)`. Hover: `22.4 PPs elapsed, 3.7 remaining` (pure) and
  `22.5 / 3.8` (COLA-weighted).
- A **PP-arithmetic tooltip** on any projection cell: hover shows
  `YTD × (26.1 / 22.4) = $X (pure)` and `× (26.295 / 22.535) = $Y (COLA-aware)`.

**Excel export notes:**

Include a `Calendar` sheet for downstream compatibility, but built KosPos-style:

- One row per PP with all per-PP fields (A:E or A:F equivalent).
- A header block of **named-range constants** (`PP_Elapsed`, `PPs_In_FY`,
  `PPs_Remaining`, `As_Of_Date`) — replaces the I2/J2/K2 + M2/N2/O2 magic cells with
  documented names.
- **Per-BU COLA columns** added next to the single-COLA column when the dept has
  multiple bargaining units.
- A **"Reference notes"** block in the sheet citing the Controller's pay calendar
  source and the per-BU MOU citations for the COLA schedule.

**Open questions / TODO:**

- [ ] Confirm with Alex: Jun 30, 2026 +2.0% is intentionally ignored (~one weekday
      impact).
- [ ] Confirm `'BI Payroll'!X` is the canonical PPE column in the OBI BI Payroll
      export (will resolve during BI Payroll walkthrough; if it's a different column,
      `H2` formula needs adjusting per FY).
- [ ] Decide where the `job class → bargaining unit` lookup lives — `domain/dhr.md`
      or a separate `domain/bargaining-units.md`?
- [ ] Settle the per-projection-page UI for the pure-vs-COLA-aware delta: always show
      both, or show only when the delta exceeds a threshold (e.g., >0.5%)?

### Tab 6 — P&P Data

**Status:** walkthrough — done 2026-05-25

**Purpose:** The **position-and-personnel snapshot** for the workbook. One row per
active or proposed position in DBI + CPC (604 positions at this snapshot, mirroring
the DBI/CPC merger-prep scope already noted for BI Payroll). Carries position
identity, classification, incumbent person details, manager linkage, RTF status,
budget linkage, and chartfield mappings. P&P Data is the **position spine** of the
workbook in the same way that BI Payroll is the **actuals spine**: Report Data joins
to it; Inactive cross-references it; EE Additional Pay / Reporting Tree / Pos by
Dept / Vacancies and TEMP / TEMP Limits / Staffing Plan / Step all pull from it
(via XLOOKUP or pivot caches). Rename a column upstream and the entire downstream
chain breaks silently — same blast-radius problem as BI Payroll.

**Snapshot scope.** 604 data rows × 138 columns (A:EH) at this snapshot. Columns
A:CJ (88) are the OBI export; CK:EH (50) are derived in the workbook. Distribution:

- **Position Status:** 536 Approved + 68 Proposed.
- **Position Fill Status:** 490 FILLED + 87 VACANT + 21 PARTIALLY FILLED + 6 OVER FILLED.
- **Department spread:** DBI Inspection Services (153) / CPC Current Planning (144) /
  DBI Permit Services (111) / DBI Administration (73) / six other CPC divisions (123).
- **Appointment types:** PCS (429), ELC (35 — elected/commissioner), PEX (29), TEX
  (19), TPV (5 — Temporary Provisional, CS Rule 114.5), blank=vacant (87).

#### Data sources

- **Source system:** OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence), labor-report query over
  PS HCM Position + Job + RTF tables. See [`../data-sources/obi.md`](../data-sources/obi.md)
  and [`../data-sources/ps-hcm.md`](../data-sources/ps-hcm.md).
- **Refresh cadence:** Alex re-runs the OBI query manually — typically when he
  re-pulls BI Payroll on paydays, or any time a significant position change happens
  between paydays. Full snapshot replaces the prior export.
- **Snapshot field:** Column A `Snapshot Date` = 2026-05-20 in this export (a
  Wednesday, two business days before the 5/21 workbook timestamp). Snapshot date is
  recorded *in the data*, not just the filename — an improvement over BI Payroll.
- **v1 KosPos mechanism:** user uploads each P&P snapshot; importer treats it as
  **full-replace per snapshot** (same model as BI Payroll). Snapshot history preserved
  so position-change history (job-code reclassifications, reports-to moves, employee
  assignments) can be diffed.
- **v2 KosPos mechanism:** Snowflake direct query when the data platform exposes the
  source.

#### Companion reference dataset — citywide department tree

The workbook silently depends on a **citywide department classification tree** that
does *not* live in P&P Data itself but is required to fix the CH `Effective Employee
Division` placeholder for non-DBI positions. Available as `Department Classification
Structure (16).csv` (14,240 rows, 64 dept groups across SF) from the same OBI report
library; refreshed periodically as new codes are added.

KosPos importer joins each position's `Position Department ID` (col G) against this
tree to resolve the full hierarchy: Department Group → Division → Section → Unit →
Sub-Unit → Department Code + Description. This eliminates the workbook's "Update
Formula" placeholder pattern (see § Manual / fragile).

Other chartfield trees live in the same OBI folder (Account, Activity, Authority,
Fund, Project, WBS, Agency Use, Account Budget Control, Department Budget Control,
TRIO) and become reference data when the corresponding KosPos modules need them.
Only the Department tree is documented here.

**UX convention (Alex):** every chartfield rendered anywhere in the app must show
**code AND description** in the same control (e.g., `229235 — CPC Current Planning`,
not one or the other). Applies to all chartfield types, not just department.

#### Department-code semantics (critical to model correctly)

Three different "department" concepts collide in P&P Data, and the workbook treats
them as distinct columns. KosPos must preserve the distinction:

| Concept | P&P Data column(s) | Mutability | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Budgeted department** | CB Budget Department Code 1 / CC Budget Department Description 1 | **Locked at budget adoption**; cannot change mid-year | Which department owns the budgeted FTE / position count |
| **Effective department** | CE Employee Department Code / CF Employee Department Description / CG Effective Employee Department (rolled-up text) | Mutable any time in PS HCM | Where the employee actually works (reports physically / functionally) |
| **Combo department** | BD Combo CD DEPTID / BE Combo CD DEPT Description | Set per-employee via combo code | What chartfield string payroll posts to |

**Default behavior:** payroll posts to the budgeted position's chartfields. **When
an employee moves mid-year**, the position's effective department updates in PS HCM
but the budget cannot change until the next budget cycle. To redirect payroll to the
new department's chartfields, a **combo code** must be added for that employee. The
combo code is the bridge between effective-department changes (any time) and
budgeted-department locks (annual).

This three-way modeling is why the workbook has so many "department" columns.
KosPos must:

1. Store all three on the Position record explicitly: `budgeted_dept`,
   `effective_dept`, `combo_dept`.
2. Surface mismatches as Data Issues (e.g., `effective_dept ≠ budgeted_dept ∧
   combo_dept = budgeted_dept` → "employee moved but no combo code added, payroll
   still charges old dept").
3. Show all three in any Position Detail view, with labels, so users don't conflate
   them.

#### Formulas / structure — OBI export columns (A:CJ, 88 columns)

Grouped by purpose. The full inventory follows.

##### Identity (A:N) — position metadata

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Snapshot Date | date | OBI run date — 2026-05-20 in this snapshot |
| B | **Position Number** | int | **PS HCM position number; primary key** |
| C | Position Job Code | int | 4-digit SF job class (`1450`, `5380`, etc.) |
| D | Position Description | text | Job-class display name |
| E | Position Status | text | `Approved` (536) / `Proposed` (68) |
| F | Position Division | text | DBI/CPC division ("DBI Inspection Services", etc.) — DBI-only nine values + one Zoning |
| G | Position Department ID | int | 6-digit PS HCM dept code; joins to the citywide dept tree |
| H | Position Department Description | text | |
| I | Position Max Headcount | int | Almost always 1 (563); pool positions show 30 / 7 / 10 / 3 / 2 for as-needed temps |
| J | Position Full Part Time Description | text | `Full-Time` (595) / `As Needed` (7) / `Reg Work Schedule<1,040 Hours` (2) |
| K | Position Regular or Temporary | text | `R` for all 604 — every position is *regular* at this snapshot. The *appointment* can still be temporary (see AF/AG). |
| L | Position TX Job Code | text | TX (Transit Authority) job-code mapping — empty for DBI/CPC |
| M | Position Fill Type | text | `PERMANENT` (491) / `PERMANENT EXEMPT` (71) / `TEMPORARY EXEMPT` (35) / `None` (7) — the *position's intended* fill type, distinct from the appointment mechanism |
| N | Position Fill Status | text | `FILLED` (490) / `VACANT` (87) / `PARTIALLY FILLED` (21) / `OVER FILLED` (6) |

`K` (position regular/temp) is *position-level*; `AF` (employee appointment type) is
*appointment-level*. A row can have `K=R ∧ AF=TEX` (a temp-exempt incumbent in a
regular position). Central to [appointment-types.md § exempt class vs exempt
appointment](appointment-types.md#exempt-class-vs-exempt-appointment).

##### Vice / acting (O:V)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| O | Position Filled Headcount | int | How many bodies currently occupy this position |
| P | Employee ID Vice 1 | int | Primary acting / "vice" person |
| Q | Employee Name Vice 1 | text | |
| R | Employee ID Vice 2 | int | Secondary acting / vice |
| S | Employee Name Vice 2 | text | |
| T | Previous Employee | text | Who held the position before (if known) |
| U | Position Used For | text | `Acting Assignment` (8 rows) — marks positions whose seat supports an acting role |
| V | Position Used For Description | text | The position number being supported (when U is `Acting Assignment`) |

Vice 1/2 names the person acting in *this* position; Position Used For names the
*position the acting person is acting in*. A clean acting relationship requires both
pointers; many positions have one without the other.

##### Person / incumbent (W:AC)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| W | Current Employee ID | int | Empl ID of the current incumbent |
| X | Current Employee Rcd | int | PS HCM `EMPL_RCD` (multi-job indicator: 0 = primary) |
| Y | Employee Status | text | `A` (511) / `L` on leave (6) / blank vacant (87) |
| Z | Person Full Name | text | "Last,First [M]" |
| AA | Employee First Name | text | |
| AB | Employee Last Name | text | |
| AC | Preferred Name | text | Override for display |

##### Classification / compensation (AD:AJ)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AD | Employee Job Code | int | **Can differ from C** when incumbent is acting in a different class |
| AE | Employee Job Description | text | |
| AF | **Employee Appointment Type** | text | `PCS` (429) / `ELC` (35) / `PEX` (29) / `TEX` (19) / `TPV` (5) / blank vacant (87). ELC = elected/commissioner; TPV = Temporary Provisional (CS Rule 114.5). See [appointment-types.md](appointment-types.md). |
| AG | **EE Exempt Category Description** | text | Charter §10.104 sub-section name. 12 distinct values in this snapshot — `00 Not Exempt` (434), `03 Comsnrs, Boards & Committee` (35), `18 Special Proj - Limited Term` (26), `06 Deputy Dept Heads` (6), `C2 Temp Exempt Retiree` (4), `08 Conf. Secty/Exec Asst` (3), `17 Substitutes for EE On Leave` (3), `12 Prof Services (CSC)` (2), `04 Comm Board Secretary` (2), `05 Dept. & Agency Heads` (1), `16 Temp & Seasonal` (1), `__NOT_APPLICABLE__` (87 vacant) |
| AH | Employee Step | int | Step within the class's salary range |
| AI | Employee Hourly Rate | numeric | Snapshot rate from PS HCM (pre mid-year COLA bump if applicable) |
| AJ | Employee Merit Increase Date | date | Drives next step advance |

##### Reporting line (AK:AN)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AK | **Position Reports To** | int | **Position-to-position parent edge** — the supervisor's *position number*, not name |
| AL | Manager First Name | text | Resolved name of the incumbent of AK's position |
| AM | Manager Last Name | text | |
| AN | Manager Name Vice 1 | text | When the manager's position is vacant or acting, this gives the acting incumbent |

##### PCS leave (AO:AS) — current leave from a permanent position

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AO | PCS Leave Date | date | When the employee went on PCS leave |
| AP | PCS Leave Appointment Type | text | The appointment type they're on leave from |
| AQ | PCS Leave Job Code | int | |
| AR | PCS Leave Department Group | text | |
| AS | PCS Leave Position Number | int | Position they're on leave from (links to a Cat 17 backfill chain) |

##### Contact / Cat 17/18 tracking (AT:AY)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT | Work Phone | text | |
| AU | IAM Email Address | text | `firstname.lastname@sfgov.org` |
| AV | CAT_17_18 Appointment Date | date | When the time-limited TEX appointment started |
| AW | **CAT_17_18 Exempt Code** | text | `17` (3) / `18` (26) / blank (575). **Column tracks ONLY Cat 17 and Cat 18** — the two date-bounded non-renewable categories. Cat 16 (hours-based) and C2 (Temp Exempt Retiree) appear in AG but NOT here. |
| AX | CAT_17_18 Exempt Months | int | Months allowed under the category (typically 24 for Cat 17, 36 for Cat 18) |
| AY | CAT_17_18 Exempt TX Expired Date | date | When the appointment expires (drives TEMP Limits date warnings) |

##### Roster (AZ:BA)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AZ | Roster Code | text | 5-char roster (matches BI Payroll col AA); links to Tab 8 Roster Approvers |
| BA | Roster Code Description | text | |

##### Combo / chartfield (BB:BH)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BB | Combo Code | int | PS chartfield-string combo |
| BC | Combo CD Fund Code | int | |
| BD | Combo CD DEPTID | int | **Combo department** — see § Department-code semantics |
| BE | Combo CD DEPT Description | text | |
| BF | Combo CD Project ID | int | |
| BG | Combo CD Activity | int | |
| BH | Combo CD Authority | int | |

##### RTF — Request to Fill (BI:BN)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BI | Latest RTF ID | text | e.g., `RTF0120903` |
| BJ | RTF Request Action | text | `FILL A VACANT POSITION` (292) / `FUTURE VACANCY` (201) / `BACKFILL` (12) / `MODIFICATION` (10) / blank (89) |
| BK | RTF Submitted Date | date | |
| BL | RTF Status | text | `APPROVED` (532) / `IN WORKFLOW` (3) / `DENIED` (3) / blank (66) |
| BM | RTF Approval Step | text | `Completed` (532) / `Rejected` (3) / `Controller/Mayor` (2) / `DHR-CS` (1) / blank (66) — workflow position |
| BN | RTF Expected Fill date | date | Drives the vacancy-fill projection |

[appointment-types.md](appointment-types.md) is correct that "RTF" is internal
SFDHR / PeopleSoft vocabulary for the Rule 113 Personnel Requisition workflow.
KosPos preserves the RTF label because the data carries it, but presents it as the
operational concept it is.

##### Budget (BO:CD) — budgeted attributes per the FY ASO

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BO | Budget Position Number | int | Usually `= B` but can diverge after re-pos / split |
| BP | Budget Position Primary Job Code | int | |
| BQ | Budget Temp Position | text | `Y` (35) / `N` (525) / blank (44) |
| BR | Budget Position Total FTE | numeric | |
| BS | Budget Fiscal Year | int | `2026` everywhere in this snapshot |
| BT | BUD_SEQ_KEY 1 | int | PS Budget internal key |
| BU | Budget Job Code 1 | int | |
| BV | Budget Job Description | text | |
| BW | Budget FTE 1 | numeric | |
| BX | Budget Project Code 1 | int | |
| BY | Budget Activity Code 1 | int | |
| BZ | Budget Fund Code 1 | int | |
| CA | Budget Authority 1 | int | |
| CB | Budget Department Code 1 | int | **Budgeted department** |
| CC | Budget Department Description 1 | text | |
| CD | Split Funded | text | `No` (593) / `Yes` (11) — position funded across multiple chartfields. The `1` suffix on BT:CC implies further numbered columns (`2`, `3`, …) would exist when more than one split is in play; not present in this snapshot. |

##### Effective department + vacancy tracking (CE:CJ)

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CE | Employee Department Code | int | |
| CF | Employee Department Description | text | |
| CG | Effective Employee Department | text | Rolled-up text (typically = CF) |
| CH | Effective Employee Division | text | **Manual OBI lookup table; DBI-only**. 267 CPC rows (44%) carry the literal string `"Update Formula"`. KosPos derives this from the citywide dept tree. See § Manual / fragile. |
| CI | Vacant Date | date | When the position became vacant (drives RTF date / TEMP backfill logic) |
| CJ | Vacant TEMP | text | `Y` (14) / blank (590) — marks positions held vacant for an incoming TEMP-track candidate |

#### Formulas / structure — derived columns (CK:EH, 50 columns)

Six groups; **none come from OBI** — all are computed in the workbook.

1. **Cross-tab status (CK:CL)** — lookups *out of* P&P Data, not derivations *within* it.
   - `CK Exclude = XLOOKUP(B, 'Report Data'!D, 'Report Data'!R)` — reads a manual
     exclusion flag from Report Data's `R` column. `Y` (11 rows) excludes the
     position from various downstream rollups.
   - `CL Included In Staffing Plan = IF(XLOOKUP(B, 'Staffing Plan'!B, 'Staffing
     Plan'!B, "") = "", "", "Y")` — checks whether this position has a Staffing
     Plan entry. 60 of 604 positions have entries.
2. **Formatted IDs (CM:CN)** — zero-padded 8-digit position-number strings used by
   the hierarchy climb.
   - `CM Pos # Formatted = TEXT(B, "00000000")`.
   - `CN Rep To # Formatted = TEXT(AK, "00000000")`.
3. **Hierarchy climb (CO:DJ)** — 22 columns implementing an 11-level reports-to
   walk. Shape:
   - `CO Level 1 = IF(AK="", CM, "")` — a position is its own L1 when it has no
     Reports-To.
   - `CP L1C = IF(CO="", "", COUNTIF(CO$2:CO2, "??*"))` — a sequence number per L1
     entry.
   - For levels 2–11: `Level N = IF(ISERROR(XLOOKUP($CN, prior-level-col,
     $CM:$CM)), "", $CM)` — walks one step up by asking "what `L(N-1)` position has
     my Reports-To as its own position number?".

   Each level rebuilds in place on every recalc. Tolerable at 600 rows × 11 levels;
   does not generalize to a citywide org with deeper chains.
4. **Employee Level array formula (DK)** — array formula constructs a display string
   like `"L05-#1450-00304335-1450/1450-Suzette Parinas"` for the position, used by
   Reporting Tree.
5. **Per-level filtering and naming (DL:EG)** — 22 columns (`1R` through `11R` +
   `1RC` through `11RC`). `R` columns hold formatted position+name strings; `RC`
   columns hold the trailing name component (cleaned via
   `RIGHT(R, LEN(R) - 19)`). Reporting Tree consumes the `RC` columns as the
   visible names of each level.
6. **Pay differential (EH) `Rep To Pay Above`** —
   `IFERROR(IF(N="VACANT", "", (XLOOKUP(CN, CM, AI) - AI) / XLOOKUP(CN, CM, AI)), "")`.
   Percent difference between this employee's hourly rate and the rate of the
   incumbent in their Reports-To position. Negative when the employee earns *more*
   than their supervisor — a supervisory-differential audit signal. Feeds EE
   Additional Pay's `Sum of Rep To Pay Above` pivot.

#### TEMP-category column reconciliation (resolves Calendar walkthrough open question)

The workbook tracks temp/exempt categories in **two different columns** with **two
different scopes**:

| Column | Scope | Values in this snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| `AG EE Exempt Category Description` | **All** Charter §10.104 sub-categories + `C2 Temp Exempt Retiree` + `00 Not Exempt` | 12 distinct: 00, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, 12, 16, 17, 18, C2, `__NOT_APPLICABLE__` |
| `AW CAT_17_18 Exempt Code` | **Only** the two date-bounded non-renewable cats (17 and 18) | 17 / 18 / blank only |

Both prior descriptions are correct, just measuring different things:

- **[definitions.md "16/17/c2"](definitions.md)** describes the *full TEMP cohort*
  relevant for temp-hour tracking — Cat 16 (hours-based) + Cat 17 + C2 Temp Exempt
  Retiree. Cat 18 isn't in this list because Cat 18 is special-project special-class
  on a date clock — not the same operational category as the short-term temps.
- **Tab 12 TEMP Limits "16/17/18"** describes the *time-limit-tracking cohort* the
  tab surfaces: Cat 16 (hours-tracked via BI Payroll's `1,040 − SUMIFS(hours)`
  formula) and Cat 17 / 18 (date-tracked via AV / AW / AX / AY).

KosPos models all three:

- `appointment.exempt_category` — free-form taxonomy from AG, mapped to
  [appointment-types.md](appointment-types.md).
- `appointment.cat_17_18_expiry_date` — only set for Cat 17 / 18 appointments.
- `appointment.cat_16_hours_remaining` — derived, only for Cat 16, computed from
  BI Payroll using the TEMP Limits formula. C2 (Temp Exempt Retiree) gets its own
  field; CalPERS sets hour rules for retiree returnees separately from the
  §10.104 categories.

#### How each downstream tab consumes P&P Data

Reference table so future per-tab walkthroughs can lean on this section instead of
re-deriving the join shapes.

| Tab | Mechanism | Volume | What it pulls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Report Data** (Tab 20) | XLOOKUP (248) + pivot 17 | 124 lookups on Position Number; 28 each on `CH` (Effective Emp Div), `CB`+`CC` (Budget Dept), `BE` (Combo Dept Desc); pivot exposes 17 row fields | The position spine — every row in Report Data has a corresponding row here, or is flagged in Inactive |
| **Inactive** (Tab 13) | XLOOKUP (2,556) | 1,278 lookups on Position Number (`B`); 639 each on `H` (Pos Dept Desc) and `F` (Pos Division) | Reconciliation: positions paid in BI Payroll but absent from P&P (separated temps whose position was inactivated). `F2 = XLOOKUP(A2, 'P&P Data'!B:B, 'P&P Data'!B:B)` confirms "this position number exists in P&P"; blank result means it's truly inactive |
| **Staffing Plan** (Tab 24) | XLOOKUP (1,844) | Pulls position metadata when a hiring plan entry references an existing position: `D` (Pos Desc), `CG` (Effective Emp Dept), `BP` (Budget Pos Primary Job Code), `AL`+`AM` (Mgr First+Last), `T` (Previous Employee), `CI` (Vacant Date), `AD` (Emp Job Code), `AF`+`AG` (Appt Type, Exempt Cat), `AH` (Step), `AZ`+`BA` (Roster) | Pre-fills hiring plan rows with current position state |
| **Step** (Tab 18) | Pivot 14 (cache 1) | 17 row fields | Per-position frame that the YTD Operating STEP Actual SUMIFS (from BI Payroll) joins to |
| **Pos by Dept** (Tab 22) | Pivot 19 | 18 row fields + 2 page filters (`Exclude`, `Included in Staffing Plan`) + count data field | Position census by department |
| **Vacancies and TEMP** (Tab 23) | Pivot 20 | Same as Pos by Dept + `Vacant TEMP` + `Pos # Formatted` | Vacancy + TEMP filter view; feeds Staffing Plan |
| **TEMP Limits** (Tab 12) | Pivots 5, 6, 7 (cache 1) | Job Code, Empl Rcd, Emp First, Job Desc, Appt Type, `CAT_17_18 Exempt Code`, `CAT_17_18 Exempt Months`, Roster, Effective Emp Dept, Vacant Date (+ Step + Exempt Cat in pivot 7) | Per-position frame for temp-expiration tracking |
| **Reporting Tree** (Tab 21) | Pivot 18 (cache 4) | 24 row fields plus the derived `2RC` … `11RC` level codes | Org-chart hierarchy display (rendered as a tree via the level codes) |
| **EE Additional Pay** (Tab 9) | Pivots 3 + 4 (cache 4) | Pivot 3: Position Used For Description, Current Employee ID, Employee First Name (acting / supervisory-pay audit). Pivot 4: appointment type + manager fields + `Sum of Rep To Pay Above` data field | Audit acting and supervisory-differential anomalies |

10 pivot tables across 8 sheets are sourced from P&P Data via **two cache
definitions** (cache 1: 137 fields covering through `CL`; cache 4: 138 fields
covering through `EH`).

#### What's manual / fragile

- **`CH Effective Employee Division = "Update Formula"` for every CPC row (267 /
  44%).** Alex built a manual lookup table *inside the OBI report* that only knows
  DBI's departments; non-DBI positions get the literal "Update Formula" placeholder
  flagging that the lookup needs updating. This is the same merger-driven CPC
  inclusion shortcut already noted for BI Payroll. **KosPos fix:** join Position
  Department ID to the citywide [Department Classification Structure](#companion-reference-dataset--citywide-department-tree)
  and derive the full hierarchy (Dept Group / Division / Section / Unit / Sub-Unit)
  at display time. Placeholder ceases to exist.
- **Cross-tab columns (CK, CL) silently depend on the consumer tab existing.**
  `CK Exclude` reads `Report Data!R`; `CL Included In Staffing Plan` reads
  `Staffing Plan!B`. If those tabs are renamed, regenerated, or restructured (Report
  Data shifted columns, Staffing Plan tab renamed), these lookups silently return
  blanks and the downstream pivots' page filters on `Exclude` / `Included In
  Staffing Plan` cease to work. The columns aren't *inputs* to P&P Data — they're
  materialized views sitting in P&P's space.
- **The 11-level hierarchy climb (CO:DJ + DL:EG, 44 columns) is per-row
  XLOOKUP-walked at recalc.** Inserting a new position with an unbroken chain to
  root is fine; inserting one with a broken Reports-To creates an `#N/A` somewhere
  in the climb that propagates through `DL:EG` and into the Reporting Tree pivot.
  No validation step.
- **Hierarchy depth is capped at 11 levels.** A 12-level chain (rare but possible
  in citywide rollout) would silently truncate.
- **`AK Position Reports To` semantics are position-to-position, not
  name-to-name.** Renaming a manager doesn't break Reports-To; *moving the manager
  out of their position* without re-pointing the reports does. Confusion source:
  the resolved manager **name** (AL/AM) updates automatically when AK's incumbent
  changes, so users can mistake AL/AM as the source of truth.
- **`AF` appointment type can disagree with `AG` exempt category in ways the docs
  don't fully resolve.** In this snapshot: 15 rows are `AF=PEX ∧ AG="18 Special
  Proj - Limited Term"` — but [appointment-types.md](appointment-types.md) defines
  PEX as Charter §10.104 subs 1–15 + 19, and Cat 18 should be TEX. Likely cause:
  Exempt-to-Permanent conversion (per [appointment-types.md § Exempt class vs
  exempt appointment](appointment-types.md#exempt-class-vs-exempt-appointment))
  where the appointment converts but the position's exempt-category designation
  persists. Worth surfacing in Data Issues rather than silently treating AG as
  authoritative.
- **`Vice 1` (P/Q) and `Position Used For` (U/V) are two separate Vice
  mechanisms.** Vice 1 names the person acting in *this* position; Position Used
  For names the *position the acting person is acting in*. A clean acting
  relationship requires both pointers; many positions have one without the other.
- **`Snapshot Date` (A) is consistent across all rows** — there's no per-position
  effective-dated history within a single snapshot. To track "when did position
  X's reports-to change," KosPos needs to keep per-snapshot history (same diff
  feature already planned for BI Payroll).
- **No defensive header-name sniff on the OBI export.** Every downstream XLOOKUP
  and pivot reference uses literal column letters. Adding or reordering a column
  in the OBI report breaks the workbook silently. Same blast-radius problem as
  BI Payroll.
- **`L`, `K`, and `BS` are constants in this snapshot but unenforced.**
  `L Position TX Job Code` is empty for all 604 rows; `K Position Regular or
  Temporary` is `R` everywhere; `BS Budget Fiscal Year` is `2026` everywhere.
  Reasonable to keep them as columns (they vary across departments / fiscal
  years) but downstream formulas don't realize they're constant.
- **No combo-code mismatch detector exists in the workbook.** When an employee
  moves departments mid-year, a combo code must be added to redirect payroll. The
  workbook gives you three columns (`CC`, `CG`, `BE`) but no flag that "these
  three disagree in the bad way." Easy to miss; payroll silently charges the old
  dept's budget.

#### KosPos improvements

##### 1. Position is a first-class entity; P&P Data is a snapshot import

P&P Data isn't a "tab" in KosPos — it's the source for the **Position** entity that
the entire app revolves around. The importer parses each P&P snapshot into Position
records with explicit fields for the three department concepts (budgeted, effective,
combo), the two appointment columns (mechanism in `AF`, exempt category in `AG`),
RTF state, Cat 17/18 expiry tracking, and an explicit reports-to position pointer.

**Derived columns (`CK Exclude`, `CL Included In Staffing Plan`, `CH Effective
Employee Division`, the 44-column hierarchy climb, `EH Rep To Pay Above`) do NOT
become Position fields** — they're computed views:

- **Exclude** → user annotation; persists with the Position as `exclude_from_rollups`.
- **Included In Staffing Plan** → derived query — ask the Staffing Plan if it
  contains this position; never materialized on the Position record.
- **Effective Division** → derived join — look up `Position Department ID` in the
  citywide dept tree; never materialized.
- **Hierarchy climb** → derived walk of `reports_to_position_id`; never materialized.
- **Rep To Pay Above** → derived query at view time from the position's hourly rate
  and its reports-to position's incumbent's rate.

##### 2. Snapshot history + diff (mirrors BI Payroll improvement #1)

Each P&P snapshot is preserved with its `Snapshot Date`. Snapshot diff surfaces
per-position changes: reports-to moves, employee transitions, RTF status changes,
vacancy-date appearances/disappearances. Powers a "What changed since last
snapshot?" view the workbook can't provide.

Importer is idempotent (uploading the same snapshot twice produces no change);
uploading a same-day re-pull warns rather than overwriting silently.

##### 3. Header-driven fingerprint import (same pattern as BI Payroll)

Match OBI columns by canonical-name substring, not by letter position. Critical
fingerprints:

| Fingerprint | KosPos field | Why critical |
|---|---|---|
| "position number" | `position.id` | Primary key |
| "position reports to" | `position.reports_to_position_id` | Hierarchy spine |
| "position job code" | `position.job_code` | Classification |
| "position fill status" | `position.fill_status` | Vacancy logic |
| "current employee id" | `position.incumbent_employee_id` | Person link |
| "employee appointment type" | `appointment.type` | Tenure rules |
| "ee exempt category description" | `appointment.exempt_category` | Charter §10.104 sub |
| "cat_17_18 exempt code" + "expired date" | `appointment.cat_17_18_*` | Time-limit enforcement |
| "vacant date" / "rtf expected fill date" / "rtf status" | `position.vacancy_state.*` | Vacancy projection |
| "budget department code 1" / "budget fte 1" / "budget position primary job code" | `position.budget.*` | Budget linkage |
| "combo cd dept description" | `position.combo_dept` | Chartfield mapping |
| "effective employee department" | `position.effective_dept` | Operational dept |

A missing fingerprint at import time blocks the import with a clear "column not
found" error rather than silently producing zeros.

##### 4. Citywide department tree as a companion reference dataset

Import `Department Classification Structure.csv` once (refresh whenever new dept
codes are added). The Position importer joins each position's `Position Department
ID` against the tree at load time and exposes the full hierarchy (Dept Group →
Division → Section → Unit → Sub-Unit) as derived attributes. **The workbook's
"Update Formula" placeholder ceases to exist** because the join works for all 64
dept groups, not just DBI.

The other chartfield trees in the same OBI folder (Account, Activity, Authority,
Fund, Project, WBS, Agency Use, Account Budget Control, Department Budget Control,
TRIO) become Phase 3 / 4 / 5 reference data when their consuming modules need them.

**UX convention:** every chartfield rendered in the app shows **code AND
description** in the same control (e.g., `229235 — CPC Current Planning`). Per Alex.

##### 5. Three departments modeled explicitly

Position record carries `budgeted_dept`, `effective_dept`, and `combo_dept` as
named, distinct fields (each with `code` + `description`). The Position Detail
page shows all three with labels, so users don't conflate them. Data Issues
surfaces mismatches that suggest a missing combo code — e.g., `effective_dept ≠
budgeted_dept ∧ combo_dept = budgeted_dept`. Catches the "employee moved
mid-year but nobody added a combo code so payroll is still charging the old
dept's budget" failure mode.

##### 6. Reports-To validation — error-vs-noise framework (sketch)

Reports-To should be the **supervisor**: the person who approves timesheets and
expense reports. For most staff this is clear. It gets fuzzy at the top of the
organization:

- **Commissioners** report formally to no one in the department. In practice the
  commission secretary approves their timesheets — but the secretary doesn't
  supervise them.
- **Department heads** report formally to the mayor (or the board/commission per
  Charter) but the mayor doesn't approve their timesheets. In practice the
  director's secretary or admin handles approvals.

KosPos's validation should distinguish:

- **Hard errors:** Reports-To references a Position Number that doesn't exist;
  cycles (A → B → A); climb depth exceeds a sane bound (15?).
- **Likely errors needing review:** an in-department position with no Reports-To
  *and* a Position Fill Type of `PERMANENT` (not Commissioner / Dept Head); a
  manager with an empty incumbent position holding subordinates; a Reports-To
  pointing at a separated employee's old position.
- **Noise (expected):** Reports-To blank on Commissioner / Dept Head / elected
  positions (they report outside the department); operational reporting via
  "manager's secretary approves timesheets" — surface separately as an
  *Operational Approver* attribute distinct from formal reports-to.

This framing is a sketch. Full rule set deserves its own session, likely after the
Reporting Tree (Tab 21) walkthrough. **The app's correction-list feature is a
major surface area:** users want a generated list of "things that look wrong,
please confirm" rather than silent failure or blocking errors.

##### 7. Hierarchy climb is computed, not materialized

The workbook's 44 columns of `CO:DJ + DL:EG` hierarchy climb don't survive into
KosPos. Instead:

- Position records carry only `reports_to_position_id`.
- Hierarchy is computed lazily by walking the chain on demand (with cycle
  detection).
- The Reporting Tree, Pos by Dept, Vacancies and TEMP, and TEMP Limits views
  become live queries over the Position store, not consumers of materialized
  level codes.

##### 8. Supervisory-pay-differential as a derived metric

`EH Rep To Pay Above` is a reasonable audit signal but lives outside Position
state. Implement as a query in the EE Additional Pay surface (Phase 4 special-class
audit), computed at view time from each position's `incumbent.hourly_rate` and its
reports-to position's incumbent's rate. Surface negative deltas as a Data Issues
flag ("subordinate earns more than supervisor") with optional explanation (acting,
longevity, special-class pay).

##### 9. Snapshot Date and Source recorded with the import

Every Position record (and every snapshot diff) records:

- `snapshot_date` (from col A — already on the OBI export, unlike BI Payroll).
- `snapshot_source` (`OBI` / `OBI → Snowflake` / future direct query).
- `dept_groups` (sourcing set: `{"DBI", "CPC"}` in this snapshot).

The snapshot becomes self-describing — Operating Report Detail's "what's the as-of
for this view" query has a real answer.

##### 10. Importer data-quality flags (additions to `lib/quality/`)

- **Reports-To resolves**: every non-empty `AK` must reference an extant Position
  Number in the same snapshot.
- **Reports-To cycle**: `A → B → A` or longer cycles.
- **CPC division resolves**: `CH Effective Employee Division` shouldn't literally
  equal `"Update Formula"` — surfaces stale lookup tables on import.
- **Vacant-but-no-RTF**: `Fill Status = VACANT ∧ Latest RTF ID is blank` for
  non-pool positions.
- **RTF expected past**: `RTF Expected Fill date < today ∧ Fill Status = VACANT`
  — the RTF date should have produced a fill.
- **Cat 17 / 18 expiry warning**: position has `CAT_17_18 Exempt TX Expired Date`
  ≤ 90 days from today.
- **Cat 16 hours approaching cap**: cross-reference with BI Payroll TEMP Limits
  formula; warn at 80 % of 1,040 hours.
- **Appointment ↔ Exempt-Category mismatch**: e.g., `AF=PEX ∧ AG starts with "18
  Special Proj"` flags an Exempt-to-Permanent conversion worth confirming.
- **Combo code missing for moved employee**: `effective_dept ≠ budgeted_dept ∧
  combo_dept = budgeted_dept` (payroll posts to old dept).
- **Hierarchy depth exceeds 11**: warns about positions whose climb extends past
  the workbook's modeled depth.
- **Snapshot row-count sanity**: compare to prior snapshot; warn on > 5 % swing
  not explained by known position adds/removes.

#### KosPos UI sketch

P&P Data is **internal staging** in the same way BI Payroll is — its data surfaces
through the Position entity and the views that read it. No P&P-only page.
Touchpoints:

1. **Upload page** (Settings → Data Sources → P&P Data):
   - Drop the OBI `.xlsx` (or `.csv` when Snowflake exposes it). Importer validates
     fingerprints, reports diff vs prior snapshot (new / removed positions,
     reports-to changes, RTF status changes, vacancy-date appearances).
   - Snapshot list with timestamp, Snapshot Date, row count, dept-group set.
     Active-snapshot toggle.
   - Companion dataset: Department Classification Structure CSV (uploaded here;
     refreshed independently).
2. **Position Detail page** (the main user-facing surface — see also Phase 7 org-chart
   when that lands):
   - Header: Position Number, Job Code + Description, Fill Status, Dept (effective
     shown by default; budgeted and combo shown with labels if they differ).
   - **Incumbent block**: name, appointment type, exempt category, step, hourly
     rate, merit increase date.
   - **Reports-To block**: parent position + climb breadcrumb up to root + the
     incumbent of each ancestor.
   - **RTF block** (when vacant or hiring): status, request action, submitted
     date, expected fill date, approval step.
   - **Cat 17/18 / Cat 16 block** (when applicable): appointment date, expected
     expiry, hours-used (for Cat 16, joined from BI Payroll), days/hours remaining
     gauge.
   - **Vice / Acting block** (when applicable): Vice 1, Vice 2, Position Used For
     pointer.
   - **Budget block**: budgeted FTE, budgeted job code (= or ≠ filled job code),
     budgeted dept, split-funded indicator.
   - Drill-down tabs: Payroll Detail (per [Tab 7 § UI sketch](#kospos-ui-sketch-7)),
     Snapshot History (this position's changes over time), Data Issues (flags from
     `lib/quality/`).
3. **Data Issues panel** (`lib/quality/`):
   - Cross-cutting view aggregating P&P-related flags grouped by category,
     exportable as a correction-list (per the major Alex requirement).

#### Excel export notes

KosPos's Excel emitter rebuilds a P&P-equivalent sheet for round-trip parity but
cleaned of the workbook's derived columns:

- A **`Positions` sheet** with the 88 OBI columns plus explicit named columns for
  the three department concepts (no "Update Formula" placeholder; unresolved
  dept-tree joins flagged in Data Issues).
- A **`Position Hierarchy` sheet** with one row per position and a single
  materialized `parent_position` + an integer `depth` + a path string
  (`/1112304/1112305/304335`). Replaces the 44-column climb with a 3-column
  representation; hierarchy views in KosPos render from this directly.
- A **`Position Snapshot Diff` sheet** (between two named snapshots) — new
  positions, removed positions, reports-to changes, RTF status transitions, etc.
- A **`Position Data Issues` sheet** — the live correction-list, formatted for a
  user to walk through one row at a time.
- Named ranges for `POSITIONS_FILLED`, `POSITIONS_VACANT`, `POSITIONS_OVERFILLED`,
  `POSITIONS_TEMP` so a side-by-side parity workbook can name-reference them.

#### Open questions / TODO

- [ ] **Confirm the PEX-on-Cat-18 rows are Exempt-to-Permanent conversions** (15
      rows in this snapshot). Alternatives: (a) classification error in PS HCM;
      (b) the EE Exempt Category Description column shows the *position's* exempt
      designation rather than the *appointment*'s, in which case PEX-on-Cat-18 is
      the appointment converting but the position's designation persisting
      (consistent with [appointment-types.md § exempt class vs exempt
      appointment](appointment-types.md#exempt-class-vs-exempt-appointment)).
      Worth a one-shot DHR query during Phase 4.
- [ ] **TPV definition.** Five rows are `AF=TPV ∧ AG="00 Not Exempt"`. Likely
      Temporary Provisional (CS Rule 114.5) but [appointment-types.md](appointment-types.md)
      doesn't have a TPV entry in the Quick Reference table. Add after confirming.
- [ ] **Reports-To error-vs-noise rules.** The Improvement #6 sketch is a starting
      point; full rule set deserves its own session after the Reporting Tree (Tab
      21) walkthrough. Includes the Operational Approver (timesheet approver)
      data model — currently no column carries this.
- [ ] **Per-snapshot vs per-position effective dates.** `Snapshot Date` (col A) is
      identical across all rows. Confirm whether OBI can emit per-position
      effective-dated changes (would let KosPos compute change history without
      snapshot diffs) or whether snapshot history is the only path.
- [ ] **Other chartfield trees.** Account, Activity, Authority, Fund, Project, WBS,
      etc. live in the same OBI folder. Document each when its consumer surfaces;
      only the Department tree is documented here.
- [ ] **Combo-code maintenance workflow.** When an employee moves departments, a
      combo code must be added so payroll posts to the new dept's chartfields.
      Currently no column in P&P Data tells you *which* employees moved without a
      new combo code — must be inferred from `effective_dept ≠ budgeted_dept ∧
      combo_dept = budgeted_dept`. Confirm whether the OBI report can flag this
      directly.
- [ ] **Pivot caches 1 vs 4.** Two different P&P caches (137 fields vs 138 —
      cache 4 includes `EH Rep To Pay Above`, cache 1 stops at column 89). Resolve
      whether the dual caches are deliberate (cache 4 for EE Additional Pay only)
      or accidental (one cache went stale).
- [ ] **`Position Used For Description` numeric values.** Col V is mostly blank but
      contains 8 numeric values like `37644`, `235254`. Likely the target position
      number for an acting assignment — confirm during EE Additional Pay walkthrough.
- [ ] **Split funded numbered columns (`2`, `3`, … suffix).** The `1` suffix on
      `BUD_SEQ_KEY 1`, `Budget Job Code 1`, `Budget FTE 1`, etc. implies the OBI
      export would emit `2`, `3` numbered columns when a position has more than
      one split. None present in this snapshot. Confirm OBI behavior so the
      importer can grow column-count dynamically.

### Tab 7 — BI Payroll

**Status:** walkthrough — done 2026-05-25

**Purpose:** The **transactional payroll feed** for the workbook. One row per
`(person × pay-period × earnings-code × chartfield-string)`. At the snapshot
(`Labor Report 5.21.26.xlsx`) the tab carries 110,027 rows for FY26 YTD
(2025-07-04 through 2026-05-08) totaling $84,252,500.67. It is the single source
of truth for every actuals figure in:

- the **Calendar** tab's "as-of date" (`Calendar!H2 = MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)`),
- the **Premium**, **Overtime**, **Retirement Payout** tabs (each is a
  pivot-cache view of BI Payroll filtered by Account Description),
- the **Step** tab's `YTD Operating STEP Actual` column (per-position per-PP
  SUMIFS that subtracts OT / RPO / Premium / Temp lump-sum from the position's
  total regular labor),
- the **Report Data** tab's per-PP per-position regular labor columns (same
  shape as Step but multi-fund),
- the **TEMP Limits** tab's "hours remaining" formula
  (`1040 − hours-worked-by-this-temp-at-this-position`),
- the **Inactive** tab's "what did this position actually get paid?" total
  (column E `Sum of Balance Amount`, computed from the cache),
- the **Budget Summary** tab's BY+1 projection anchor
  (`MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)` again, as the projection "as-of" PP).

Six of the workbook's pivot caches live on the BI Payroll tab — three of them
(`pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`) are reused across the Premium / Overtime /
Retirement Payout tabs. Translation: **rename a column on this tab and the
entire downstream chain breaks.**

**Snapshot scope.** The export currently covers two department groups:
**DBI** (67,078 rows) and **CPC** (42,949 rows). The DBI/CPC pairing is
**merger-driven**: the report was originally DBI-only; Alex has begun expanding
it to CPC in anticipation of the DBI/CPC consolidation, but that expansion is
still in progress. Long-term direction: connect the report directly to
Snowflake so this manual OBI re-pull can be retired. Until then, BI Payroll is
manually re-exported every payday (every other Tuesday) — see § Data sources.

#### Data sources

- **Source system:** OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence), `BI Payroll` report,
  scoped to `Department Group Code IN (DBI, CPC)` and `Fiscal Year = 2026` at
  this snapshot. See [`../data-sources/obi.md`](../data-sources/obi.md).
- **Refresh cadence:** Alex re-runs the **full FY-to-date** query every
  pay-day Tuesday (every two weeks). PeopleSoft posts payroll + the PS
  Financials journal entries the day before payday (sometimes earlier). A pure
  incremental-append model isn't safe because **prior-PP adjustments happen
  retroactively** (a corrected timesheet from PP10 might land in the export 4
  PPs later); a full re-pull catches those rewrites.
- **v1 KosPos mechanism:** user uploads each FY snapshot; importer treats it as
  a **full-replace** for the FY (not append). Snapshot history is preserved so
  the Operating Report Detail "what changed since last run" feature has prior
  snapshots to diff against.
- **v2 KosPos mechanism:** Snowflake direct query when SF's data platform
  exposes the source. See [`../data-sources/obi.md`](../data-sources/obi.md)
  on the Snowflake-vs-OBI uncertainty.

#### Formulas / structure — column inventory

The tab is **flat data only — no formulas in any cell of BI Payroll itself.**
Every column comes straight from OBI. 39 columns:

| Col | Header | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Fiscal Year | int | `2026` at snapshot |
| B | Department Group Code | text | `DBI` / `CPC` — drives RPO pivot's dept-group rollup |
| C | Fund Lvl 1 Code | int | Hierarchy parent (`10000` GF / `10100`-band SR / etc.) |
| D | Fund Lvl 1 Desc | text | Hierarchy parent description |
| E | Fund Control | text | `FACCT` (annual) / `FCNT` (continuing) — see [`budget-process.md`](budget-process.md) |
| F | **Fund Code** | int | **6-digit fund.** Used by Step tab's `10190` (DBI BIF operating) filter |
| G | Fund Description | text | "SR BIF Operating Project" etc. |
| H | Department Code | int | 6-digit dept ID (`229235`, `109733`, etc.) |
| I | Department Description | text | "DBI IS Building Inspection" etc. |
| J | Project Code | int | Chartfield-string component |
| K | Project Description | text | |
| L | Activity Code | int | Chartfield-string component |
| M | Activity Description | text | |
| N | Authority Lvl 1 Code | int | Hierarchy parent (`10000` Operating, etc.) |
| O | Authority Lvl 1 Description | text | |
| P | Authority Code | int | Chartfield-string component |
| Q | Authority Description | text | |
| R | Account Lvl 2 Description | text | `Expenditures` / `Liabilities` — almost all is Expenditures |

#### Earnings-code dictionary observed in this snapshot

Built by streaming the full export. 58 distinct earnings codes (counting null
as one). Top buckets, with their dollar share of the $84.25M total:

| Earnings code(s) | Description | $ (DBI+CPC) | Routes to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WKP` | Regular Hours - Worked | $49.1M | Position regular labor (Step `S` column subtracts after excluding OT/RPO/PREMM/Temp LSP) |
| _(null)_ | (benefit lines have no earnings code) | $21.4M | Mandatory fringe accounts (5130xxx) — health, retire, OASDI, dental, life, LTD, etc. |
| `XXX` | `***Unspecified***` | $3.51M | **Sick leave TRCs hidden by Controller** — see § Manual / fragile |
| `VAP` | Vacation Leave Pay | $3.38M | Position regular labor (no exclusion) |
| `LHP` | Legal Holiday Pay | $2.62M | Position regular labor |
| `FHP` | Floating Holiday Pay | $1.24M | Position regular labor |
| `VPO` | Vacation Pay Out | $534k | **RTPOM** (account 510210 or 505060 for temp) |
| `OTP` | Overtime Pay 1.5 | $423k | **OVERM** (account 511010) |
| `CTP` | Comp Time Pay | $414k | **PREMM** (posts to 509010 Premium Pay - Misc per MOU) |
| `253` | Certification Prem - 6% | $265k | **PREMM** |
| `SVO` | Severance Pay Out | $149k | **RTPOM** |
| `125` | Certification Prem - 4% | $133k | **PREMM** |
| _(structural-eng)_ | Structural Eng Prem - 10.27% | $124k | **PREMM** |
| _(mgmt-leave)_ | Management Leave Pay | $117k | Position regular labor (not the cashable balance — that's RPO; this is paid time off taken) |
| `289` | Bilingual Pay - $60.00 | $54k | **PREMM** (per [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § PREMM_E) |
| `L08` | Lead Worker Pay - $5 | $22k | **PREMM** |
| `OTF` | FLSA Overtime Pay | (small) | **OVERM** |
| ~40 other premium / leave / retro codes | various | residual | Mix |

The **routing rule** is the workbook's downstream filter: each pivot or SUMIFS
keys on `Account Description` (column V), not on earnings code directly. The
earnings-code → account mapping is determined upstream in PeopleSoft / TRC
configuration, not in this tab. Importer implication: KosPos should aggregate
on Account Description first (mirroring how the workbook slices), but keep the
earnings code in the row so per-code drill-downs and the PREMM per-class-type
breakdown (Bilingual vs Cert Prem 6% vs Lead Worker, etc.) remain possible.

#### How each downstream tab consumes BI Payroll

A complete reference so future per-tab walkthroughs (Premium, Overtime, RPO,
Step, Inactive, TEMP Limits) can lean on this section instead of re-deriving.

##### Calendar — `H2 = MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X)` → 2026-05-08

Single-cell read. Drives every elapsed-PP computation in the workbook. See
Tab 5 walkthrough for the math; the only BI Payroll dependency is that **PPE
column X is the "as-of date"** for the whole workbook. See Improvement #5
("Decouple as-of date from BI Payroll import") in the Calendar walkthrough.

##### Premium — pivot from `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`

- **Pivot:** `Premium!A3:J116` (pivotTable9, cache 1006).
- **Page filter:** `Account Description = "Premium Pay - Misc"` (single
  account 509010).
- **Row fields:** Department Group Code → Department Description → Job Code →
  Job Description → Earnings Code → Earnings Code Description (six-level
  group-by, displayed as outline rows).
- **Column field:** Fund Code (one column per fund — 10190 DBI BIF, 10000 CPC
  GF, 10020 GF Continuing, 10840 CPC Planning Code Enforcement, ...).
- **Data field:** `Sum of Balance Amount` (column AL).
- **Downstream:** `Operating Report Summary!E36 = GETPIVOTDATA("Balance
  Amount", Premium!$A$3, "Fund Code", 10190)` pulls the DBI fund-10190 cell.
  See [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § PREMM_E.

##### Overtime — pivot from `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`

- **Main pivot:** `Overtime!A5:BL114` (pivotTable11). Page filter:
  `Account Description = "Overtime - Scheduled Misc"` (account 511010). Row
  fields: Fund → Department → Job Code → Job Desc → Person Full Name.
  Column field: Earning Period End Date (one column per PP). **Data field:
  `Sum of Earning Hours`** (column AJ) — *not* dollars. The visual is a
  per-person per-PP OT hours matrix.
- **GETPIVOTDATA target:** `Operating Report Summary!E37 =
  GETPIVOTDATA("Sum of Balance Amount", Overtime!$A$3, "Fund Code", 10190)`
  pulls the dollar figure from a parallel pivot — both `Sum of Earning Hours`
  and `Sum of Balance Amount` exist as data fields in the cache; the visible
  pivot displays hours, while the GETPIVOTDATA call references the dollar
  aggregation by name.
- **Smaller pivots:** `Overtime!BP5:BR19` (pivotTable13) — Sum of Balance
  Amount by Dept Grp × Department for OT account only, used as the
  per-department YTD anchor for the projection formula. Plus the BFM-sourced
  budget reference table at `BK5:BN8` (pivotTable12).
- **Projection rollup:** `Overtime!BS15` (cited by `OPS!H37`) consumes these.
  See [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § OVERM_E.

##### Retirement Payout — pivot from `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`

- **Pivot:** `Retirement Payout!A5:AF66` (pivotTable15). Page filter:
  `Account Description = "(Multiple Items)"` — manually checked accounts.
  In this snapshot the two visible items in the pivot XML are the indices
  pointing at the two RPO accounts (`510210` "Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc"
  and `505060` "Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff"). Row fields: Dept Grp → Dept →
  Job Code → Job Desc → Person → Earnings Code → Earnings Code Description.
  Column fields: Fund Code (outer) × Earning Period End Date (inner).
- **Downstream:** `Operating Report Summary!E38 = GETPIVOTDATA("Balance
  Amount", 'Retirement Payout'!$A$3, "Department Group Code", "DBI")` —
  the workbook rolls up by **Department Group Code = DBI** here (not by
  fund), so it picks up both perm RPO (510210) and temp lump-sum (505060)
  for the whole DBI group, regardless of fund. See
  [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § RTPOM_E.
- **Earnings codes in this pivot:** `VPO` (Vacation Pay Out — $534k) and
  `SVO` (Severance Pay Out — $149k) are the only two contributors in this
  snapshot. The "Multiple Items" account filter is what *includes* the
  $71k of Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff (`505060`) alongside the perm RPO
  account. **Account-vs-earnings-code reconciliation:** account 510210 =
  $650k + 505060 = $71k = $721k; VPO+SVO sum = $683k — the $38k spread
  comes from VPO/SVO posting that doesn't carry an earnings code on a
  small number of liability adjustments (seen in Account Lvl 5 = `200075`
  "Payroll Employee Reimbursement"). Worth a deeper look during the RPO
  walkthrough but doesn't break the OPS!E38 number, which pulls from
  the pivot's account-filtered total.

##### Step — per-position per-PP SUMIFS

The Step tab's `S` column (`YTD Operating STEP Actual`) is computed as
`SUM(BY2:CY2)` where each `BY..CY` cell is one PP. Per-PP cell shape (e.g.,
`U2` is PP-of-2025-07-04):

```excel
U2 = IF(COUNTIF($D$2:$D2, $D2) > 1, 0,
       SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL,
              'BI Payroll'!$AD:$AD, $D2,       -- position
              'BI Payroll'!$X:$X,  U$1,         -- this PP
              'BI Payroll'!$F:$F,  10190)       -- fund 10190 only (DBI shortcut)
       - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Overtime - Scheduled Misc")
       - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc")
       - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Premium Pay - Misc")
       - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff"))
```

In words: **regular-labor dollars per position per PP, in fund 10190 only,
excluding the four special-class accounts.** The `COUNTIF` guard ensures only
the first occurrence of a position number contributes (positions can appear
multiple times in the Step tab — one per appointment / split).

Four columns referenced: `AL` (amount), `AD` (position), `X` (PPE), `F`
(fund), `V` (account description for exclusions). 32,670 cells reference
BI Payroll on this tab — one per `(position × PP)`.

**Fund 10190 filter is a DBI shortcut.** CPC's regular labor lives in 10000,
10840, 10770, etc. — the Step tab as currently written would compute zero
step variance for every CPC position. KosPos's per-position projection should
sum across all funds (or accept a per-call fund filter).

##### Report Data — per-position per-PP SUMIFS, **multi-fund**

Same shape as Step but **without the fund filter**:

```excel
BB2 = IF(COUNTIF($D$2:$D2, $D2) > 1, 0,
        SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL,
               'BI Payroll'!$AD:$AD, $D2,    -- position
               'BI Payroll'!$X:$X,  Y$1)      -- this PP (no fund filter)
        - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Overtime - Scheduled Misc")
        - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc")
        - SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!$AL:$AL, ..., 'BI Payroll'!$V:$V, "Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff"))
        - Y2  -- subtracts a manual-adjustments column
```

Three columns excluded instead of four (no Premium exclusion — Report Data
includes premium in the per-position regular labor figure, presumably because
PREMM_E rolls up separately at the special-class level). 18,225 cells
reference BI Payroll on this tab. **Multi-fund-aware** because it's the
position-level dataset that everything else trues up to.

##### TEMP Limits — hours-remaining gauge

```excel
V2 = 1040 − SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!AJ:AJ,           -- earning hours
                    'BI Payroll'!Y:Y,  R2,        -- person
                    'BI Payroll'!AI:AI, "Y",      -- only FTE-counted hours
                    'BI Payroll'!AD:AD, P2)       -- this position
```

Citywide temp employees are capped at 1040 hours per FY (half-time). This
formula computes hours remaining before the cap. Different cell shape from
the per-PP iteration in Step / Report Data — only one cell per temp, summing
across the full FY snapshot. **Critical use of `AI = "Y"`** (Is FTE Hours
flag) — non-FTE hours (e.g., comp time taken in lieu of OT pay) don't count
against the temp cap.

##### Inactive — total spend per inactive position

Column `E` (`Sum of Balance Amount`) is computed from the BI Payroll pivot
cache, listing positions whose PPE activity exists in BI Payroll but whose
position number doesn't appear in P&P Data. Per Alex's description in
[`labor-report.md`](labor-report.md) § Tab 13: when a temp separates, the
position is inactivated and drops off P&P, but BI Payroll retains the FYTD
record. The Inactive tab catches these so they can be hand-added to Report
Data.

##### Budget Summary — BY+1 projection anchor

```excel
B20 = -SUM(INDEX('Report Data'!$Y$2:$CB$350, 0,
                 MATCH(MAX('BI Payroll'!X:X), 'Report Data'!$Y$1:$CB$1, 0)))
      * Calendar!N2
      - 'Staffing Plan'!X30 - 'Staffing Plan'!X41
```

Uses BI Payroll only to find "today's PPE" (`MAX(X)`) so it knows which
column of Report Data to pull. The actual values come from Report Data; the
COLA-weighted `Calendar!N2` scales them.

#### What's manual / fragile

- **Column-name dependency is total.** Every downstream formula uses literal
  column references (`$AL`, `$AD`, `$X`, `$V`, `$F`, `$AJ`, `$AI`, `$Y`,
  `$AE`). If OBI ever renames a field or shifts column order — common after
  a PeopleSoft version bump or an OBI report rebuild — **all** of Premium /
  Overtime / RPO / Step / Report Data / TEMP Limits / Inactive / Calendar /
  Budget Summary fail silently. The pivot caches (which embed the column
  names) are equally exposed. There is no defensive header sniff anywhere.
- **`'XXX' = "***Unspecified***" is the Controller hiding sick-leave TRCs.**
  This snapshot has $3.51M of payroll bucketed under XXX (4.2% of the
  workbook total). Alex has access to a permission level that unhides
  per-employee sick-leave detail but doesn't use it because the leave-detail
  isn't needed for labor-report work. **Privacy implication for KosPos:**
  sick-leave data is considered sensitive (HIPAA-adjacent, plus PII risk if
  joined to Person Number). The default importer must preserve the Controller's
  hiding — keep XXX as a single bucket, do **not** attempt to back-fill from
  unmasked sources. See § KosPos improvements #4.
- **`Earning Period Number` (col W) is all zero** in this export. Time
  slicing relies entirely on `Earning Period End Date` (col X). If a future
  OBI export populates W, no formula will start using it; if a future OBI
  export drops X, every formula breaks. Both states are equally undefended.
- **Fund-10190 filter in Step.** Step's per-PP SUMIFS filter to fund 10190
  only — works for DBI's BIF-funded operating positions but silently
  zeroes out:
  - DBI fund 10230 (BIF-Continuing — $213k in this snapshot),
  - DBI fund 10840 (Planning Code Enforcement),
  - all CPC funds (10000 GF + special revenues).
- **Account-filter strings are literal.** The OT exclusion `"Overtime -
  Scheduled Misc"`, the RPO exclusion `"Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc"`,
  the Premium exclusion `"Premium Pay - Misc"`, the Temp LSP exclusion
  `"Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff"`. If the Controller renames an account
  description (e.g., "Misc" → "Miscellaneous" in a chart-of-accounts
  refresh), every Step + Report Data + Operating Report Summary formula
  silently drops the relevant exclusion and double-counts dollars.
- **Account 509010 ("Premium Pay - Misc") is the *bulk* premium account
  but not the *only* one.** The Premium pivot's page filter is just this
  one account description. Earnings codes like Bilingual ($60 = 289),
  Cert Prem (113/125/253/etc.), Lead Worker ($5 = L08) all post to 509010.
  But some premium categories — e.g., **Structural Eng Prem - 10.27%
  ($124k)** — appear in BI Payroll with no clear posting account confirmed
  yet. If any premium variant ever posts to a different account
  description (e.g., a Police 9.5% prem to "Premium Pay - Uniformed"),
  the Premium tab would miss it. **Worth confirming during Tab 16 (Premium)
  walkthrough.**
- **CPC inclusion is in-progress.** Alex started extending the report to
  cover CPC for merger planning. The Premium / Overtime / Step / Report
  Data downstream consumers do *not* currently distinguish DBI from CPC
  in their projection formulas (Step's 10190 filter accidentally does, by
  side effect). A naive read of "total premium" from the Premium pivot
  today would mix DBI and CPC dollars. KosPos importer should keep
  Department Group Code as a first-class dimension on every aggregation.
- **`'AM' is a trailing empty column.** Pure OBI export artifact —
  KosPos importer should ignore it rather than reify a "column 39" placeholder.
- **`AE` job code prefix `COMMN:` is implicit citywide knowledge.** New
  analysts hit `"COMMN:5380"` and assume the prefix is a typo. KosPos
  should store the prefix-stripped 4-digit job code as the primary key
  and surface the prefix as metadata (originated in citywide common job
  set vs department-specific).
- **No formulas on this tab at all** — but it's *referenced* by 50,898
  formulas across Step + Report Data + Calendar + TEMP Limits + Budget
  Summary + OPS. The blast radius of any structural change is enormous.

#### KosPos improvements

##### 1. Importer is a full-replace per FY snapshot, with snapshot history

**Problem in the workbook.** Alex re-runs the full FYTD query every two
weeks because prior-PP adjustments leak in retroactively. The workbook
overwrites BI Payroll wholesale each time; there is no record of what
changed between snapshots. The Operating Report Detail tab tries to
diagnose run-over-run changes but has no real before-state to diff against
— Alex's only recourse is to keep prior workbooks around and eyeball them.

**KosPos design.** Each BI Payroll upload is treated as **the canonical
FY-to-date snapshot** for an `(fiscal_year, as_of_date)` tuple. Persist
every snapshot — small relative to the rest of IndexedDB. Two surfaces:

- **Current snapshot** is what every downstream view reads from by default.
- **Snapshot diff** view (powers the eventual Operating Report Detail
  feature): pick two snapshots, get per-position / per-account / per-PP
  deltas. Surfaces retroactive adjustments to old PPs as their own
  highlight ("PP12 was adjusted +$3,142 between the 5/8 and 5/22 runs").

Importer is **idempotent**: uploading the same snapshot twice produces no
change; uploading a newer snapshot with the same `as_of_date` warns rather
than overwriting silently.

##### 2. Header-driven importer with fingerprint-based schema detection

**Problem in the workbook.** Column letters are hardcoded in every
downstream formula. A column rename or reorder upstream breaks everything.

**KosPos design.** Continue the pattern from ADR-007 — match columns by
fingerprint (case-insensitive substring match on canonical header names),
not by position. **Update ADR-007's column list** to reflect the real
export: not pre-aggregated `YTD Salary / Benefits / Total`, but the 39
transactional columns above. Importer aggregates per
`(position, pay-period, account-description)` on the fly so downstream
KosPos modules see whatever shape they need without the workbook's
per-PP-SUMIFS gymnastics.

Critical fingerprints to detect:

| Workbook formula uses | Fingerprint | Why critical |
|---|---|---|
| `'BI Payroll'!AL` | "balance amount" | The dollar — every aggregation |
| `'BI Payroll'!AD` | "position identifier" | Per-position joins |
| `'BI Payroll'!X` | "earning period end date" | The PPE used to slice time |
| `'BI Payroll'!V` | "account description" | The text used for exclusions |
| `'BI Payroll'!F` | "fund code" | Fund-level slicing |
| `'BI Payroll'!Y` | "person number" | Per-employee aggregation |
| `'BI Payroll'!AE` | "job code" | TEMPM filter, job-class joins |
| `'BI Payroll'!AB` / `AC` | "earnings code" / "earnings code description" | Per-code drill-down (premium types) |
| `'BI Payroll'!AJ` / `AI` | "earning hours" / "is fte hours" | TEMP Limits hours math |

A missing fingerprint at import time blocks the import with a clear
"column not found" error rather than silently producing zeros.

##### 3. Pre-compute the rollup cube once, query it many ways

**Problem in the workbook.** The same 110k rows are pivoted three times
(Premium / Overtime / RPO) and SUMIFS-iterated 50k times (Step + Report
Data + TEMP Limits + Inactive). Excel does this on every recalc.
Performance is fine in a desktop workbook with one user; it does not
generalize.

**KosPos design.** On import, build a per-snapshot **rollup cube** in
memory and persist to IndexedDB:

- Primary aggregation key: `(fiscal_year, dept_group, dept_code, fund,
  position, account_description, earnings_code, pp_end_date)`.
- Stored value: `(balance_amount, earning_hours)`.
- Plus a denormalized `(position, account_description, pp_end_date) →
  balance_amount` index for the per-PP per-position queries that Step and
  Report Data need.

Every downstream view (Premium, Overtime, RPO, Step, Report Data, TEMP
Limits, Inactive, Operating Report Summary) becomes an O(k) cube query
where k is the number of grouping keys actually selected — not an O(N)
scan of 110k rows times M formula cells.

This eliminates the workbook's "pivot cache must be refreshed before
the GETPIVOTDATA cell sees the new data" failure mode (see
[`labor-report.md`](labor-report.md) § Cross-cutting / Live data, never
stale pivots).

##### 4. Preserve the Controller's sick-leave masking by default

**Problem in the workbook.** `XXX = "***Unspecified***"` carries $3.51M
in this snapshot (4.2% of total payroll) and the user has no way to
distinguish "did the employee take 8 hours of sick" from "did the
employee take 8 hours of jury duty leave" — both fall into the masked
bucket. This is a deliberate Controller-side privacy posture.

**KosPos design.** The importer keeps `XXX` as a single opaque bucket.
**Sick-leave detail is not unmasked** unless an admin user explicitly
uploads a separately-permissioned export, in which case it's stored
encrypted-at-rest in IndexedDB (and surfaces only in views the admin role
can see).

Implication: KosPos's "leave balance" reports (a future Phase 4 feature
adjacent to RPO eligibility computation) can show *aggregate* sick-leave
totals but cannot per-employee attribute them. This matches the
Controller's stance and is the right default for a department-admin tool.

Surface in the Data Issues panel as a note rather than a warning: "$3.51M
of YTD payroll is in the Controller's masked sick-leave bucket (XXX).
This is expected and intentional."

##### 5. Strip the `COMMN:` job-code prefix and store both

**Problem in the workbook.** `'COMMN:5380'` is opaque. Filters that
copy-paste a 4-digit job class don't match because of the prefix.

**KosPos design.** Importer parses `AE` into `{prefix: 'COMMN', code:
'5380'}`. Display defaults to the 4-digit code; filters and joins use
the 4-digit code. The prefix is preserved as metadata for the rare cases
where a department-specific job-set prefix matters (per
[`appointment-types.md`](appointment-types.md) § citywide common vs
department-specific). Two columns on the imported row:
`job_code = "5380"` and `job_code_set = "COMMN"`.

##### 6. Make Department Group Code a first-class dimension

**Problem in the workbook.** The current cross-tab consumers (Premium pivot,
Overtime pivot, Step SUMIFS) do not consistently group by Department Group
Code. The Premium pivot includes it as a row field (so DBI and CPC are
visible separate row groups); the Step tab's fund-10190 filter
*coincidentally* isolates DBI; the OPS!E36 cell pulls only `Fund Code =
10190` from the Premium pivot, mixing in any CPC dollars that happen to
post to fund 10190 (none in this snapshot, but not a guaranteed invariant).

**KosPos design.** Every aggregation has Department Group Code as an
explicit grouping key. Pages default to the current user's department
group (multi-dept access is a Phase 3 concern); when multi-dept is
enabled, the rollup makes the dept-group split explicit in the UI rather
than relying on a fund-code coincidence.

This also unblocks Alex's in-progress CPC extension: KosPos sees the same
BI Payroll file and produces a separate, clean CPC view without rewriting
formulas.

##### 7. Account-description rename guard

**Problem in the workbook.** Account Description literals are scattered
across hundreds of formulas. A Controller-side text change ("Ret Payout
- SP & Vac - Misc" → "Retirement Payout - Misc") would silently drop the
exclusion from Step / Report Data — every position's regular labor would
suddenly include RPO dollars, inflating projections by the RPO amount.

**KosPos design.** Account descriptions are looked up from a **central
chart-of-accounts map** (sourced from BFM or a CON publish), not
hardcoded. The map versions by effective date. The importer logs a
warning when an Account Description in the BI Payroll snapshot doesn't
match the active chart-of-accounts map — early-warns on Controller-side
renames before they break aggregations.

##### 8. Per-snapshot data-quality flags

Add to `lib/quality/` (per [ADR-003](../DECISIONS.md)):

- **Row-count sanity.** Compare to prior snapshots; warn if total rows or
  total Balance Amount changes by more than ~30% (signals a botched
  export or a query scope change like "I forgot to set Fiscal Year").
- **Negative or zero Balance Amount.** Expected for retroactive
  adjustments (negatives) but should be small share of the total. Surfaces
  outliers (a $-50,000 reversal needs human eyes).
- **Earnings Code Description without Earnings Code (or vice-versa).**
  Inconsistencies indicate OBI-side data-quality issues.
- **Fund / Account / Department Code orphans.** An unknown fund or
  account code (not in the BFM chartfield reference) suggests either a
  new chartfield or a typo upstream.
- **Position appears in BI Payroll but not in P&P Data.** Drives the
  Inactive tab automatically — no separate manual lookup needed.

#### KosPos UI sketch

BI Payroll is **internal staging**, not a user-facing module. Two surfaces:

1. **Upload page** (Settings → Data Sources → BI Payroll):
   - Drop a `.xlsx` file. Importer validates the 39-column fingerprint,
     reports diff vs. prior snapshot (row count, total Balance Amount,
     new PPE if any).
   - Snapshot list with timestamp, FY, as-of date, row count, total
     amount. Toggle which snapshot is the "active" one.
   - Per-snapshot data-quality summary (count of XXX-masked rows, count
     of zero/negative amounts, count of unknown chartfields).
2. **Per-position payroll drill-down** (a tab on the Position Detail
   page, available from every position-aware module — Report Data,
   Operating Report Detail, Inactive, TEMP Limits, etc.):
   - PP-by-PP table: PPE | Earnings Code | Description | Account | Fund |
     Hours | Amount.
   - Filter: by earnings code, by account, by PP range.
   - Quick aggregates at the top: YTD regular labor (= total − OT − RPO
     − Premium − Temp LSP), YTD OT, YTD Premium, YTD RPO, YTD Temp LSP.
   - "Trace to source": each row links to the underlying BI Payroll
     snapshot row so a user can verify a number against the raw export.

#### Excel export notes

KosPos's Excel emitter does **not** rebuild a 39-column transactional sheet
— that's an importer detail, not user-facing output. Instead:

- A **`Payroll Detail` sheet** with the per-position-per-PP table from the
  drill-down (filtered to whatever the user has selected: a department, a
  position, a fund), so a user reviewing a projection can verify the
  underlying activity in one click.
- A **`Payroll Summary by Account` sheet** with the rollup cube sliced by
  Account Description × Department × Fund × PP — replaces the manual
  Premium/Overtime/RPO pivots with a single live-query table.
- **Named ranges** for the special-class subtotals (`PREMM_YTD`, `OVERM_YTD`,
  `RTPOM_YTD`, etc.) so a user maintaining a side-by-side parity workbook
  can reference them by name instead of cell address.
- A `Reference notes` block citing the OBI report and the snapshot timestamp,
  so the file is self-documenting.

#### Open questions / TODO

- [ ] **Confirm Account Description routing for `Structural Eng Prem -
      10.27%` ($124k in this snapshot).** Does it post to account 509010
      "Premium Pay - Misc" (and therefore land in the Premium pivot
      correctly)? If not, the workbook is under-counting PREMM YTD. Resolve
      during Tab 16 (Premium) walkthrough.
- [ ] **Confirm the "Multiple Items" account filter on the RPO pivot.** The
      pivot XML shows two account-description items as visible (the rest
      hidden); inferred from accounts present in the data to be `510210`
      + `505060`. A future RPO walkthrough should open the pivot in Excel
      and confirm the human-side filter selection.
- [ ] **Reconcile the $38k VPO/SVO vs account 510210+505060 spread.** Account
      total = $721k; earnings-code total (VPO + SVO) = $683k. Investigate
      whether the difference is in `200075` payroll-employee-reimbursement
      liability bucket or a small-dollar miscategorization.
- [ ] **TEMPM filter `'BI Payroll'!AE = "COMMN:5380"` undercounts.** The
      workbook misses temp pay posting to `505020` ($49k Sick), `505040`
      ($42k Vac), `505050` ($55k Other Timeoff), `505060` ($71k LSP),
      `505070` ($44k Holiday) at the DBI+CPC level. Confirm the desired
      definition during Tab 16+ (TEMPM is on the Premium tab's adjacent
      block, or on its own Tab 40 / OPS row 40). See
      [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § TEMPM_E open question.
- [ ] **Update ADR-007.** The provisional column list (`YTD Salary / Benefits
      / Total`) was wrong — BI Payroll is transactional, not pre-aggregated.
      ADR-007 needs an amendment landing with the real 39 columns and the
      full-replace import model. Suggest doing this during the importer-build
      sub-phase (2.4) rather than now, since the deep-dive doc captures the
      real columns already.
- [ ] **Decide where the citywide chart-of-accounts map lives.** Referenced
      in Improvement #7 above — likely `lib/chartfields/` with a JSON dataset
      sourced from BFM. Belongs in [`chartfields.md`](chartfields.md) when
      that gets fleshed out.

### Tab 8 — Roster Approvers

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Query from PS HCM listing roster approvers. Rosters are a feature Alex
flagged as **important to KosPos** — full definition pending walkthrough.

**Data sources:** PS HCM query.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — Alex to explain rosters and their use)_

---

### Tab 9 — EE Additional Pay

_(Two pivots on P&P Data (cache 4) — see [Tab 6 § How each downstream tab consumes
P&P Data](#how-each-downstream-tab-consumes-pp-data). Pivot 4's data field is the
`Rep To Pay Above` derived column — feeds the supervisory-pay-differential audit.)_


**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Audits acting assignments and supervisory pay. Columns **A–R** are a PS
HCM query; the rest are formulas + pivots. Two specific checks:

1. **Acting-assignment dual-entry check.** Acting assignments must be entered in two
   places in PS HCM; this tab confirms both entries exist.
2. **Missed supervisory pay.** Identifies employees who should be receiving supervisory
   pay but currently aren't.

Detail nuance to come — acting assignments and supervisory pay are MOU-defined.

**Data sources:** PS HCM (additional-pay query) + cross-referenced P&P Data.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — Alex to walk acting/supervisory pay rules)_

---

### Tab 10 — Probation

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Tracks probationary employees. Data currently lives in an offline
spreadsheet (no known PS HCM source). **KosPos becomes the new tracker** — user input
allowed; additional functionality TBD.

**Data sources:** Offline (Alex's spreadsheet). KosPos = system of record going forward.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

### Tab 11 — Eligibility Lists

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Per-job-class eligibility lists for DBI classes. Compiled manually by
looking up each DBI class at <https://sfdhr.org/examination-results>. No structured
data source currently exists.

**Data sources:** DHR website (manual lookup). KosPos improvement: **periodic scrape**
of `sfdhr.org/examination-results` to keep current. Belongs in
[`../data-sources/dhr.md`](../data-sources/dhr.md).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open

### Tab 12 — TEMP Limits

_(Three pivots on P&P Data (cache 1) for the per-position frame — see [Tab 6 §
How each downstream tab consumes P&P Data](#how-each-downstream-tab-consumes-pp-data).
BI Payroll hours-remaining formula decoded in [Tab 7 § TEMP Limits](#temp-limits--hours-remaining-gauge).
TEMP-category 16/17/c2 vs 16/17/18 reconciliation resolved in [Tab 6 § TEMP-category
column reconciliation](#temp-category-column-reconciliation-resolves-calendar-walkthrough-open-question).)_


**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Pivot view of P&P Data filtered to temp-appointment categories (Alex's
words: "cat 16, 17, and 18"). Tracks each temp employee's expiration date so the
department can plan around them.

**Data sources:** P&P Data (pivot).

**Open inconsistency to resolve in walkthrough:** [`definitions.md`](definitions.md)
records the temp appointment categories as `16 / 17 / c2`; Alex's tab description here
says `16 / 17 / 18`. Need to reconcile — see chat clarifying question.

**BI Payroll formula (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** the "hours remaining" cell
per temp:
```excel
V2 = 1040 − SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!AJ, Y=person, AI="Y", AD=position)
```
1040 = citywide half-time annual cap. `AI = "Y"` filters to FTE-counted hours only —
non-FTE hours (e.g., comp time taken in lieu of OT pay) don't count against the cap.
See Tab 7 § How each downstream tab consumes BI Payroll.

### Tab 13 — Inactive

_(P&P Data XLOOKUP shape decoded in [Tab 6 § How each downstream tab consumes P&P
Data](#how-each-downstream-tab-consumes-pp-data) — 2,556 references on Position
Number / Pos Department / Pos Division. BI Payroll consumption shape decoded in
[Tab 7 § Inactive](#inactive--total-spend-per-inactive-position).)_


**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Cross-reference between BI Payroll and P&P Data to surface **inactive
positions** that still need to be projected. Mechanism: when a temp employee separates,
the position is inactivated; once inactive it drops off the P&P report, but BI Payroll
still shows it was paid. Since Report Data pivots primarily off P&P Data, these
inactive-but-paid positions and amounts must be **manually added** to Report Data —
this tab identifies which.

**Structure (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** Cols A-E come from the BI Payroll
pivot cache (Position Identifier, Dept Desc, Job Code, Person Full Name, Sum of
Balance Amount). Cols F:K are formulas: `F = XLOOKUP(position, 'P&P Data'!B, 'P&P
Data'!B)` (returns #N/A when position is missing from P&P → that's the inactive flag),
`G = XLOOKUP(dept, 'P&P Data'!H, 'P&P Data'!F)` (division backfill), `H =
NUMBERVALUE(RIGHT(jobcode, 4))` (strips the `COMMN:` prefix), `I/J` parse the
"Last,First" name string, `K` is the disposition flag (`Add` / blank). At snapshot,
640 rows. See Tab 7 § How each downstream tab consumes BI Payroll.

**Data sources:** BI Payroll ∪ P&P Data (lookups).

### Tab 14 — Separations

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** **Rumored / pending** separations (not a complete list, not from a system
of record). Manually maintained.

**Data sources:** Manual entry. KosPos = user-input tracker.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

### Tab 15 — Succession

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Draft feature — succession planning. Alex flagged as a possible KosPos
addition; scope TBD.

**Data sources:** Manual.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 16 — Premium

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Summary of premium pay actuals + straight-line projections. Data from
BI Payroll.

**Source pivot (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** `Premium!A3:J116` (pivotTable9
on `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`). Page filter `Account Description = "Premium Pay -
Misc"` (account 509010). Row fields: Dept Grp → Dept → Job Code → Job Desc → Earn
Code → Earn Desc. Col field: Fund Code. Data field: `Sum of Balance Amount`. Adjacent
projection panel `L3:Q11` is **not** a pivot — manual table comparing budget vs
projected per (dept × Account Lvl 5 = 5010Salary / 5130Fringe). See Tab 7 § How each
downstream tab consumes BI Payroll.

**Existing math reference:** [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § PREMM_E (partial
— `Premium!P5 / P6` decoded; `N5 / N6 / N7` ratios pending).

**KosPos improvement Alex flagged:** projections could incorporate hiring information
— some positions to be hired later will carry premium pay. Small expected impact, but
the model can be made aware.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 17 — Overtime

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Summary of overtime actuals + projections. Data from BI Payroll.

**Source pivot (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** main pivot `Overtime!A5:BL114`
(pivotTable11 on `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`). Page filter `Account Description =
"Overtime - Scheduled Misc"` (account 511010). Row fields: Fund → Dept → Job Code →
Job Desc → Person. Col field: Earning Period End Date. **Visible data field is `Sum of
Earning Hours`** (not dollars); the dollar field exists in the cache and is pulled
via the OPS!E37 `GETPIVOTDATA("Sum of Balance Amount", …, "Fund Code", 10190)`.
Secondary pivot `Overtime!BP5:BR19` (pivotTable13) provides per-dept dollar totals
feeding the BS15 projection rollup. See Tab 7 § How each downstream tab consumes BI
Payroll.

**Existing math reference:** [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § OVERM_E (fully
documented from Session 11 extraction). The labor-report-tab view is the YTD + projection
presentation; the existing OVERM UI in `app/src/modules/special-class/` is the
budget-development form (hidden in Phase 2.1).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — Alex to confirm Overtime tab BN5:BT15 dept rows 7–14 not
yet extracted; cross-ref special-class.md)_

---

### Tab 18 — Step

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Per-position step-savings YTD + projection. **Formulas are complicated**;
Alex flagged that COLA shortcuts may exist in the math and wants to review carefully.

**Source SUMIFS shape (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** the `S` column
(`YTD Operating STEP Actual`) is `SUM(BY2:CY2)`, where each `BY..CY` cell is one PP.
Per-PP cell: `SUMIFS('BI Payroll'!AL, AD=position, X=PPE, F=10190) − SUMIFS(... V="Overtime
- Scheduled Misc") − SUMIFS(... V="Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc") − SUMIFS(... V="Premium
Pay - Misc") − SUMIFS(... V="Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff")`. **Fund 10190 filter is a DBI
shortcut** — silently zeroes out CPC + DBI's BIF-Continuing (10230) positions. 32,670
cells reference BI Payroll on this tab. See Tab 7 § How each downstream tab consumes BI
Payroll.

**Existing math reference:** [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § STEPM_C (partial
— per-position cell map captured; `BY2` per-PP variance formula known to use
`XLOOKUP(BY1, Calendar!B, Calendar!C) * 80` denominator with 80-hour PP assumption baked
in, per [`definitions.md`](definitions.md)).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — Alex to confirm COLA treatment in `BY2`)_

---

### Tab 19 — Retirement Payout

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Per-employee retirement-payout actuals YTD + year-end projection. Data
from BI Payroll (earnings codes VPO, SVO).

**Source pivot (decoded during Tab 7 walkthrough):** `Retirement Payout!A5:AF66`
(pivotTable15 on `pivotCacheDefinition6.xml`). Page filter `Account Description =
"(Multiple Items)"` — inferred to be accounts `510210` "Ret Payout - SP & Vac - Misc"
+ `505060` "Temp Misc LumpSum Payoff" (the temp parallel). Row fields: Dept Grp →
Dept → Job Code → Job Desc → Person → Earn Code → Earn Desc. Col fields: Fund Code
(outer) × Earning Period End Date (inner). Data field: `Sum of Balance Amount`.
**OPS!E38 rolls up by `Department Group Code = "DBI"`**, not by fund — so picks up
both 510210 and 505060 for the whole DBI group regardless of fund. Snapshot
reconciliation: account totals $721k vs earnings-code totals (VPO + SVO) $683k —
$38k spread to investigate (see Tab 7 § Open questions). See Tab 7 § How each
downstream tab consumes BI Payroll.

**Existing math reference:** [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § RTPOM_E (fully
documented; `H38 = IF(Calendar!K2=0, E38, MAX(G38, E38))` projection).

### Tab 20 — Report Data

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** **The most important tab.** Brings together payroll, budget, hiring plan,
and other inputs into one position-level dataset. Shows budget, actuals, and projections
in one place. Source of `'Report Data'!$S$649:$S$748` references in `special-class.md`.
Alex notes: **manual to update, may contain errors**.

**Data sources:** P&P Data (primary — pivot 17 + 124 XLOOKUPs on Position Number; see
[Tab 6 § How each downstream tab consumes P&P Data](#how-each-downstream-tab-consumes-pp-data)),
BI Payroll (per-PP per-position SUMIFS for regular labor — see
[Tab 7 § Report Data](#report-data--per-position-per-pp-sumifs-multi-fund)), Inactive,
Staffing Plan, BFM — joined manually.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — high priority; this is the spine of the rebuild)_

---

### Tab 21 — Reporting Tree

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Visual org chart drawn from P&P Data — who reports to whom at each level.
Used both to **flag data errors** (broken reports-to chains, etc.) and to **communicate
system changes** to staff. Error identification is currently manual; KosPos can
automate. Precursor to the full Phase 7 org-chart module.

**Data sources:** P&P Data (Reports-To position + the derived `2RC…11RC` level codes
in cols DX:EG — pivot 18 on cache 4; see [Tab 6 § Formulas — derived
columns](#formulas--structure--derived-columns-ckeh-50-columns) and the consumer
table). The Reports-To error-vs-noise framework sketch lives in
[Tab 6 § KosPos improvements #6](#6-reports-to-validation--error-vs-noise-framework-sketch).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — enumerate the manual error-checks to automate)_

---

### Tab 22 — Pos by Dept

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Pivot view of Report Data by department. Alex notes: rarely used; low
priority. Likely subsumed by KosPos's filterable position list.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — confirm whether to keep as separate surface or fold in)_

---

### Tab 23 — Vacancies and TEMP

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Another pivot view of Report Data filtered to vacancies + temp positions.
**Used as a reconciliation check** — every vacant or temp position must appear in the
Staffing Plan. If a position is here but missing from Staffing Plan, that's a gap.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough)_

---

### Tab 24 — Staffing Plan

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** **Very important.** The hiring plan — which vacant / temp positions to
fill, when (in PP terms), at what cost. Feeds the cost ladder that Budget Summary uses.

**Data sources:** Vacancies + TEMP (tab 23), manually elaborated with fill-PP, fill-cost
estimates, and hiring sequence. Pulls 14 fields from P&P Data via 1,844 XLOOKUPs on
Position Number / Job Code — see [Tab 6 § How each downstream tab consumes P&P
Data](#how-each-downstream-tab-consumes-pp-data).

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — major surface; reserve a session for this alone)_

---

### Tab 25 — Budget Summary

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Early-attempt rollup of what next-year's budget *could* look like given
the Staffing Plan. Example logic Alex described: if you hire 100 people who all start
in PP26, the cost for this year is tiny, but next year (full year) is ~26× that. Alex
notes: rarely used in current form; the concept is right but the implementation never
matured.

**Data sources:** Staffing Plan.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — frame as BY+1 projection from current-year hiring plan)_

---

### Tab 26 — Operating Report Summary

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** **The main labor projection tab.** Budget vs actuals + special-class
budget vs actuals. The number that feeds the 6-month and 9-month reports to CON / MYR.

**Existing math reference:** [`special-class.md`](special-class.md) § "Operating
Report Summary — DBI section reference" (rows 36–42 for the special-class block — PREMM,
OVERM, RTPOM, STEPM, TEMPM, 9993). Walkthrough should fill in the non-special-class
rows.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — headline page)_

---

### Tab 27 — Operating Report Detail

**Status:** walkthrough — pending

**Purpose:** Drill-down view of Operating Report Summary. Used when investigating
**what changed between two report runs** — early in the FY, projections can swing
materially run-to-run. Alex flagged "what changed since the last report" as a clear
improvement area for KosPos.

**Formulas / Manual-fragile / KosPos improvements / UI sketch / Excel export / Open
questions:** _(walkthrough — KosPos snapshot-diff feature is the obvious win)_

---

### Ignored tabs

- **New Department Org** — DBI / CPC merger planning. Out of scope for Phase 2.
- **New Department Org - Long Term** — same, longer horizon.

If the merger lands, these become an org-restructure workspace (Phase 7 org-chart
territory or earlier "merger planning" feature). Not part of the current-year
workspace.

## Data sources inventory (built during walkthrough)

A flat list of every upstream file/query the labor report consumes. For each, capture
the v1 mechanism (manual upload? scrape?) and the eventual v2 plan (Snowflake when
available).

| Source | Used by tab(s) | v1 mechanism | v2 plan | KosPos importer path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Controller's pay calendar (PPE dates) | Calendar | Manual rebuild of Calendar tab annually (~30 min) | Generated from published Controller calendar (JSON / scraped PDF) | `lib/calendar/` — one JSON per FY |
| Per-BU MOU COLA schedule | Calendar (col E), implicitly Step, Report Data | Hardcoded single % in Calendar!E (DBI shortcut) | Per-bargaining-unit lookup sourced from DHR MOUs | `lib/cola/` (or part of `lib/dhr/`); also referenced by [`budget-process.md`](budget-process.md) |
| OBI `BI Payroll` report (transactional, 39 cols, ~110k rows for DBI+CPC FYTD) | **BI Payroll** (raw stage), Calendar (`H2`), Premium / Overtime / Retirement Payout (pivots), Step + Report Data (per-PP SUMIFS), TEMP Limits (hours math), Inactive (cross-ref vs P&P), Budget Summary (`MAX(X)` for as-of PP), Operating Report Summary (rows 36–41) | Manual OBI re-run every payday Tuesday (every two weeks); **full FYTD re-pull** because prior-PP adjustments leak in retroactively | Snowflake direct query when SF data platform exposes it; preserve full-replace import model | `lib/importers/obi-payroll/` — header-driven fingerprint, full-replace per `(fiscal_year, as_of_date)` with snapshot history retained; rollup cube precomputed on import (see Tab 7 § KosPos improvements #3) |
| OBI `P&P Data` report (position-and-personnel, 88 OBI cols, 604 rows for DBI+CPC at this snapshot) | **P&P Data** (raw stage), Report Data (XLOOKUP + pivot), Inactive (XLOOKUP), Staffing Plan (XLOOKUP), Step / Pos by Dept / Vacancies and TEMP / TEMP Limits / Reporting Tree / EE Additional Pay (pivots) | Manual OBI re-run; full snapshot replacing prior export; `Snapshot Date` recorded in col A of the data itself | Snowflake direct query when available; preserve full-replace + snapshot-history import model | `lib/importers/obi-pnp/` — header-driven fingerprint, full-replace per `(fiscal_year, snapshot_date)`, builds Position entities with three explicit dept fields (budgeted / effective / combo) and lazy hierarchy walk (see Tab 6 § KosPos improvements) |
| Citywide `Department Classification Structure` CSV (dept tree, 14,240 rows, 64 dept groups citywide) | P&P Data importer (fixes `CH Effective Employee Division` "Update Formula" placeholder); future modules that need any dept-tree-level rollup (Division / Section / Unit / Sub-Unit) | Manually downloaded from same OBI folder as the other chartfield trees; refreshed periodically as new dept codes are added | Snowflake direct query when available | `lib/reference/dept-tree/` — versioned by effective date; Position importer joins `Position Department ID` against the active tree to derive hierarchy attributes |
| Other chartfield trees in the same OBI folder (Account, Activity, Authority, Fund, Project, WBS, Agency Use, Account Budget Control, Department Budget Control, TRIO) | _(future)_ — each becomes reference data when its consuming KosPos module surfaces | Manual download from OBI; refresh periodically | Snowflake direct query | `lib/reference/<tree-name>/` — same pattern as dept tree; documented per-module as walkthroughs land |
